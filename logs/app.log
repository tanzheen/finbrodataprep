Text: Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, **AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink**.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

**Where will all of that energy come from?**

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes **as much energy as a small city**. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. **Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.**

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

**One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play.** It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

**The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom**

- It owns critical **nuclear energy infrastructure assets**, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.
- It’s one of the **only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects** across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.
- It plays **a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation**—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy **American** LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth— **collecting fees on every drop exported.**

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be **first in line** to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

**AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.**

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company **powering it all from behind the scenes**.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and **Wall Street is just starting to notice**.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

**This company is completely debt-free.**

In fact, it’s sitting on a **war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap**.

It also owns a **huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play**, giving investors **indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines** without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

**The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out**

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that **some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits**.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because **excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings**.

And that’s for a business tied to:

- The **AI infrastructure supercycle**
- The **onshoring boom** driven by Trump-era tariffs
- A surge in **U.S. LNG exports**
- And a unique footprint in **nuclear energy**—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock **this cheap**… with **this much upside**.

**This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.**

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

**Disruption is the New Name of the Game:** Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

**The Talent Pool is Overflowing:** The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Dive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Tracking Closely. On July 21, Morgan Stanley reiterated the stock as “Overweight,” noting that it’s sticking with Apple shares ahead of a solid quarter. The firm believes that strong iPhone, iPad, Mac sales, and favorable FX will lead Apple toward a robust quarter, and that its guidance will likely align with expectations. However, for the sentiment to improve, clarity on tariffs, the Alphabet ruling, and AI strategy is still required. Investors shouldn’t be hoping for any meaningful updates in terms of artificial intelligence in the quarter. The firm is of the view that investors don’t appreciate Apple’s AI efforts, particularly because it is in continuous comparison with Google, Meta, and Amazon’s work. Apple (AAPL) Analysts Stay Positive Ahead of Earnings, But AI Clarity Still Needed Stock market reports printed on a sheet of paper. Photo by RDNE Stock Project on Pexels “Our estimates are moving higher, but we still need key overhangs to dissipate before getting more structurally bullish.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

Text: In This Article: In the first quarter, billionaires David Shaw and Louis Bacon sold Apple and bought O’Reilly Automotive, a stock-split stock up 510% in the last decade. Apple is struggling to incorporate artificial intelligence into its business, and the company has gone seven-plus years without a groundbreaking new product. O'Reilly Automotive could be a winner as President Trump's tariffs encourage consumers to service older vehicles rather than purchasing new ones. 10 stocks we like better than Apple › The hedge fund billionaires listed below sold Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the first quarter and bought O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY), a company whose share price rocketed 510% over the last decade, leading to a 15-for-1 stock split in early June. David Shaw's D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. sold 340,900 shares of Apple, trimming its stake by 6%. The hedge fund also added 19,000 shares of O'Reilly Automotive, though it remains a very small holding. Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management sold 495,800 shares of Apple, cutting its stake 97%. The hedge fund also purchased 240 shares of O'Reilly Automotive, starting a very small position. Importantly, both hedge funds still have exposure to Apple, and neither has an especially large position in O'Reilly Automotive. But investors should still consider both trades for their own portfolios. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Apple has durable brand moat built on design expertise that spans hardware and software. The company once again led the market in smartphone revenue in the March quarter, and it posted double-digit sales growth in its services segment due to strength in advertising, the App Store, and cloud storage. But its overall performance was still uninspiring. Revenue rose 5% to $95 billion, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income climbed 5% to $24.8 billion. Importantly, Apple has struggled to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into its business. Analysts thought the suite of generative AI features added last year (i.e., Apple Intelligence) would catalyze a massive iPhone upgrade cycle, but the consumer response has so far been underwhelming, perhaps because the company has repeatedly delayed highly anticipated AI upgrades to its digital assistant Siri. Apple's failure to monetize AI speaks to a larger problem: The company has seemingly lost its capacity for innovation. After a long stint of very successful product launches -- the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2015, and AirPods in 2017 -- Apple has now gone seven-plus years without a noteworthy new product. And its inability to capitalize on soaring demand for AI is a troubling continuation of that pattern.

Text: Apple stock is down 15% year to date, but most Wall Street analysts are optimistic ahead of the company's upcoming earnings report.

**Apple**( [AAPL](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) 0.07%) is no longer the most valuable company in the world. It ceded the title to **Microsoft** in May, then slipped behind **Nvidia** in June. Apple stock has dropped 15% year to date over concerns about tariffs and its artificial intelligence strategy.

Nevertheless, most Wall Street analysts rate Apple stock a buy ahead of its third-quarter financial report, which is due after market close on Thursday, July 31. Among 51 analysts, the median target price is $236 per share, which implies 10% upside from the current share price of $214.

Here's what investors should know.

## Apple is beset by headwinds related to tariffs and artificial intelligence

Apple consistently leads the market in smartphone revenue, but the company also captured the top spot in smartphone shipments in the March quarter. Nevertheless, Apple still reported unimpressive financial results. Revenue rose 5% to $95 billion and [GAAP](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/generally-accepted-accounting-principles/) net income rose 5% to $24.8 billion.

Tariffs are a potential problem. **Jefferies** analyst Edison Lee says import taxes could be a 7% headwind to earnings, assuming the U.S. imposes a 10% tariff on India, a 20% tariff on Vietnam, and a 30% tariff on China. But that creates downside risk. President Trump has announced a deal with Vietnam but has not secured long-term deals with India or China.

Beyond tariffs, investors are concerned about Apple's [artificial intelligence](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/) (AI) strategy or lack thereof. Many analysts touted generative AI capabilities added with Apple Intelligence as the catalyst for a major iPhone upgrade cycle, but consumers have been unimpressed. The company has also repeatedly delayed promised AI upgrades for Siri.

In addition, many analysts assumed Apple would eventually launch a paid version of Apple Intelligence with premium AI features, but the company has yet to make any such announcements. So the question remains: How will Apple monetize artificial intelligence?

Elsewhere, Apple could lose a substantial amount of services revenue depending on the outcome of an antitrust lawsuit involving **Alphabet**. To elaborate, a federal judge last year ruled against Alphabet, finding the company had an illegal monopoly in internet search. One remedy would be prohibiting or limiting its ability to pay Apple for default search placement on the Safari browser. That could cost Apple in excess of $20 billion per year.

## What Wall Street expects from Apple in its upcoming earnings report

Apple will announce financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in June, after the stock market closes on Thursday, July 31. Forecasts from Wall Street set a relatively low bar for the company. These are the consensus estimates:

- Revenue will increase 3.6% to $88.9 billion.
- Earnings will increase 1.4% to $1.42 per diluted share.

Importantly, Apple topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 2.5% over the \[past four quarters, but shares still fell by an average of 1.2% after the past four reports. That means beating estimates is not sufficient to send the stock higher. Instead, price action following the report is likely to depend on commentary about tariffs and AI.

Finally, pricing data from options contracts currently implies a 3.5% post-earnings move. In that scenario, the stock would close between $207 and $222 on the day after the report.

## Apple stock is still expensive despite falling 15% year to date

Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to grow at 6% annually through the fiscal year ending in September 2026. That makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look expensive. That gives a [price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/p/peg-ratio/) above 5. Traditionally, stocks with PEG ratios above 3 are considered overvalued.

Apple introduced in the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2015, and AirPods in 2017. But the company has now failed to develop a groundbreaking new product for seven-plus years. Does that mean Apple has lost its ability to innovate? Without a new catalyst, be it artificial intelligence or something else, I doubt Apple stock can move sustainably higher from its current price.

Text: People look at iPhones at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York City on May 23, 2025.

Adam Gray \| Reuters

[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) and miner [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/) [announced](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-and-apple-announce-500-million-partnership-to-produce-recycled-rare-earth-magnets-in-the-united-states) a [$500 million deal](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-expands-us-supply-chain-with-500-million-usd-commitment/) Tuesday for rare earth magnets and the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker’s U.S. supply chain.

MP Materials stock climbed 20%. Shares of Apple were marginally higher.

As part of the agreement, Apple will buy rare earth magnets created at the company’s facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Both companies will combine on a new rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. MP Materials plans to start shipping magnets in 2027.

“American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.”.

Apple said the deal will create dozens of new manufacturing and research and development roles.

Rare earth magnets are key components that make up everything from consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers to cars and renewable energy systems.

For years, the U.S. has worked on curbing its reliance on China, which [dominates](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) the global rare earth elements supply chain. MP Materials operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S.

Earlier this month, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in the rare earth miner, [buying $400 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html) in preferred stock to improve rare earth magnet supply on American soil.

Apple announced a plan to [invest more than $500 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/24/apples-plan-to-invest-500-billion-in-th-u-s.html) to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities earlier this year. The plan included a [new factory](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/apple-to-open-texas-ai-server-factory-in-500-billion-us-expansion.html) for artificial intelligence servers in Texas.

Shares of MP Materials have nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, pushing the miner’s market capitalization to nearly $10 billion. The stock has nearly doubled over the last month.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc Tim Cook-by John Gress Media Inc via Shutterstock With a year-to-date loss of 15%, Apple (AAPL) is the second-worst performing “Magnificent 7” stock this year. Only Tesla (TSLA) has fared worse than Apple among the coveted group, thanks to news flow around CEO Elon Musk’s politics, which often tend to overshadow the more pressing issues that the company needs to address. As for Apple, the YTD underperformance comes amid the growing perception that it slacked big time on artificial intelligence (AI). As Wedbush analyst Dan Ives aptly said, “Apple is at a highway rest stop on a bench watching this Fourth Industrial Revolution race go by at 100 miles an hour.” It’s Never ‘Happened in the History of Tech to Any Company Before’: OpenAI’s Sam Altman Says ChatGPT is Growing at an Unprecedented Rate This Penny Stock Wants to Become the MicroStrategy of Dogecoin Option Volatility And Earnings Report For July 21 - 25 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now! Some other headlines are even more unforgiving, with one even claiming Apple stock is for “losers.” That said, the iPhone maker remains the largest holding for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), and the “Oracle of Omaha” does not appear to be in a mood to sell more shares after trimming the holdings to a round figure of 300 million shares. In this article, we’ll gauge how bad things are for Apple, as a section of the market questions whether CEO Tim Cook is the best person to lead the Cupertino-based company amid its recent underperformance. www.barchart.com While other Big Tech companies have ramped up their AI capex, filling up Nvidia’s (NVDA) coffers in that process, Apple hasn’t seen a commensurate rise in its AI spending. The company’s “Apple Intelligence” features have been quite gradual, and while Apple maintains that iPhone sales have been better in regions where these features are available, they haven’t moved the needle much, or at least that’s what the sales numbers tell us. The argument about Apple slacking on its AI initiatives gained momentum following last month’s WWDC, where the new features were not exactly groundbreaking and, in many cases, Apple appeared to be playing catch-up with its competitors. For example, despite Siri having the first-mover advantage in the digital assistant space, it is still well behind AI assistants offered by the likes of OpenAI. There have been rumours about Apple considering acquiring AI startup Perplexity. However, I believe the possibility of that acquisition looks dim as, firstly, Apple has historically not made large acquisitions. Plus, it has prioritized privacy in its AI development, unlike Perplexity.

Text: **Apple Inc.** AAPL has had a bruising start to 2025, with its stock down about 18% year-to-date and underperforming the broader stock market by 22%—its worst [half-year stretch since 2013.](https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/25/05/45675595/apple-eyes-worst-month-vs-sp-500-since-2018-but-history-says-buy-the-dip-now)

But as July kicks off, investors may find a surprisingly bullish signal in an unexpected place: the calendar.

### Why Has Apple Struggled So Much In 2025?

The first half of the year was defined by a perfect storm for Apple—trade tensions, delays in product innovation and a growing AI gap all chipped away at investor confidence.

One of the biggest headwinds came from President **Donald Trump**‘s renewed tariff agenda. In 2024, Apple generated 64% of its total revenue from overseas, with Greater China and Europe being among its most profitable regions. But in early 2025, trade-related uncertainty soured consumer sentiment abroad, especially in China.

The numbers confirm it: in the first quarter of 2025, Apple's revenue from Greater China dropped 13% year-over-year to $16.37 billion, down from $18.25 billion during the same quarter of 2024. Local rivals, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, gained market share, while demand for iPhones softened.

Then came Apple's AI problem. While **Microsoft Corp.** MSFT, **Alphabet Inc.** GOOGL, and **Nvidia Corp.** NVDA captured market buzz with new AI-driven features and products, Apple offered few details.

With no firm AI roadmap and delays around the iPhone 17 and the Vision Pro international rollout, many investors began rotating out of Apple into higher-growth tech names like **Nvidia**, **Palantir Technologies Inc**. PLTR **Meta Platforms Inc**. META and **Broadcom Inc.** AVGO

### Can Apple Turn Things Around In July?

On the surface, Apple seems out of favor. But dig into the seasonality, and July could offer the kind of bullish argument that flips the narrative.

Apple's seasonal gains in July are unmatched. Over the past 20 years, the stock has ended July higher 17 times, with an average return of 7.6%.

Even more impressive, Apple is riding a 9-year winning streak in July. The best performances came in 2022 (+18.9%) and 2006 (+18.6%).

Expand the scope to 30 years, and the signal remains intact: Apple averaged a 7.3% gain in July, with a 77% win rate (23 positive closes out of 30).

The biggest drawdowns occurred in 2001 (-19.2%), 2002 (-13.9%), and 2008 (-5.1%)—but those were years defined by broader market crises.

More recently, pullbacks have been minor, like -3.3% in 2015 or -0.6% in 2004.

Apple's relative performance versus the S&P 500 in July has been positive in 77% of the past 30 years, with an average outperformance of 5.8%.

No other S&P 500 stock has matched that consistency or magnitude over the same period.

In short, Apple hasn't just risen in July—it's crushed the market in July, time and time again. And with sentiment scraping cycle lows in 2025, history suggests July has often been Apple's golden window for a rebound.

Text: 📈 Apple Stock Presents a Hidden Opportunity Amid Market Highs

While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are setting fresh all-time highs, not all major tech names are moving in sync. In fact, the underperformance of certain fundamentally sound companies has quietly opened up a rare investment window. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)—a long-time favorite of both retail and institutional investors, is now sitting at a discount relative to the broader tech sector. This scenario offers a compelling entry point for those who know where to look.

As more speculative tech stocks hog the spotlight, patient investors have a chance to capitalize on quality. Apple's recent lag in stock price, despite strong fundamentals, makes it a standout opportunity in the current market climate.

🔍 Why Apple Stock is Lagging Despite Strong Fundamentals

While the Nasdaq-100 Index has soared to new highs, Apple stock is trading at just 82% of its 52-week peak. This nearly 20% discount is not the result of any fundamental weakness or brand deterioration, it’s a classic example of market psychology. Investors, caught up in the hype around AI stocks and semiconductors, have temporarily diverted capital away from stable growth names like Apple.

The result? A price gap that isn’t rooted in declining performance, but in fear of missing out (FOMO) on newer, riskier names. This divergence creates fertile ground for long-term investors to step in.

📊 Price Action Suggests a Hidden Upside

Apple’s stock price today reflects a unique mispricing rather than a long-term outlook. Despite its dominance in both hardware and software, and a nearly unmatched brand loyalty across the globe, the stock remains undervalued compared to its historical performance.

With the market overextending in other directions, savvy investors are starting to view Apple as a value play, even in the growth-heavy tech sector. This isn’t just a technical bounce in the making; it’s a structurally sound business trading at a relative bargain.

🧠 Smart Money Is Moving Into Apple

Institutional investors are beginning to take notice. In June 2025, Swedbank increased its holdings in Apple by 2.4%, bringing its total investment to $4.3 billion. While the percentage increase might seem modest, this level of commitment at such a large dollar value speaks volumes.

Big players don’t place billion-dollar bets lightly. Their moves suggest that Apple’s stock is poised for a significant rebound in the coming months one that the broader market has yet to fully recognize.

📣 Wall Street Analysts Remain Bullish on AAPL

Despite its recent underperformance, Apple continues to receive strong endorsements from top analysts. Daniel Ives of Wedbush recently reiterated his Outperform rating on AAPL, setting a bold $270 price target. That’s a projected 27% upside from current levels, a rare forecast for a company with a market cap exceeding $3 trillion.

This bullish stance is grounded in expected earnings growth. Wall Street predicts Apple will report $2.34 EPS in Q1 2026, a massive 42% increase from today’s $1.65 EPS. That kind of earnings trajectory is typically accompanied by corresponding stock price appreciation.

📉 Apple’s Premium Valuation Still Holds Merit

Despite trading at a lofty 56.6x price-to-book (P/B) multiple, far above the tech sector’s 7.1x average, Apple continues to justify its premium. The reason? Its unmatched brand equity, product ecosystem, and technological moat.

Investors have historically been willing to pay up for quality, and Apple represents one of the purest forms of that in the public markets. When a company consistently delivers on innovation, customer retention, and financial performance, high valuations become not only acceptable but expected.

⏳ Patience Will Be Rewarded

In the current market cycle, characterized by hype, momentum, and viral stock movements, Apple offers a rare contrast: stability, strength, and long-term value. Investors who stay grounded in fundamentals rather than chasing fads are likely to be rewarded handsomely.

The undervaluation of Apple shares, coupled with institutional buying and strong earnings projections, makes this a compelling moment for entry. As the market inevitably rotates back to quality, Apple is well-positioned to benefit.

🚀 Final Thoughts: Apple Stock is a Long-Term Win

Now is not the time to overlook Apple. Its stock may not be grabbing headlines like AI startups or semiconductor darlings, but it’s quietly building momentum. As earnings improve and investor sentiment realigns, Apple is poised to retake its position as a market leader, not just in products, but in performance.

If you're looking for a low-risk, high-potential investment in 2025, Apple may very well be the most compelling choice on the board.

Text: Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day: 1. Butting heads President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated visit to the Federal Reserve on Thursday included an attention-grabbing back-and-forth with Chairman Jerome Powell. It was a sight to behold: Trump and Powell wore white hard hats as they toured an area of the central bank under construction — a project that has been a talking point of the president’s as he’s criticized Powell. As Trump told reporters that renovations of two buildings were costing around $3.1 billion, Powell began shaking his head. Powell said he had not heard that from anyone at the Fed and, after being handed a sheet of paper, explained that the figure included another building’s work from years prior. On a friendlier note, Trump insinuated he was leaving behind the idea of firing Powell, a possibility that’s concerned investors in recent months. CNBC’s Kevin Breuninger laid out the entire scene, which marked the first official visit of a president to the Fed in nearly two decades. 2. More all-time highs Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the opening bell on July 18, 2025, in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty Images It’s been a nice week for investors in S&amp;P 500 -based funds like the VOO or SPY. The broad index has notched new all-time closing highs every day so far this week, bringing its total tally for record closes in 2025 to 13. Meanwhile, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has recorded three all-time-high closes this week alone. All three of the major U.S. stock market indexes are on track to end the week higher. Follow live market updates here. 3. Spending intel Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan speaks at the company’s Annual Manufacturing Technology Conference in San Jose, California, U.S. April 29, 2025. Laure Andrillon | Reuters Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced several spending cuts in a Thursday memo, particularly focused on a division called foundry that produces chips for other companies. Tan put it rather plainly, saying that there would be “no more blank checks” and that investments “must make economic sense.” As CNBC’s Kif Leswing explained, this arm of the business has an operating loss and is in need of a large, centerfold customer. The belt-tightening already appears to be in motion, per Tan: Intel has axed planned fab projects and is consolidating some operations abroad, as well as slowing the construction timeline for a chip factory in Ohio. 4. Clock’s ticking Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce speaks during the Pennsylvania Energy And Innovation Summit 2025 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh on July 15, 2025. David A. Grogan | CNBC After kicking the can down the road for ByteDance to divest from the U.S. business of social media app TikTok, the White House is trying to — literally — lay down the law. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday that it will be lights out for the short-form video platform beloved by Gen Z if it cannot find American owners by the Sept. 17 deadline. Users got a taste of this scenario in January, when Apple and Google removed the platform from their app stores as a prior deadline loomed. On the old economy side of things, Lutnick told CNBC that the major U.S. automakers are “cool with” the trade agreement forged with Japan. 5. Nobody but Sydney Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney star in Sony’s “Anyone But You.” Sony If you clicked on CNBC’s homepage on Thursday, you likely saw a prominently displayed story about actress Sydney Sweeney’s campaign for American Eagle Outfitters driving meme stock traders to the name. It’s one of those cases where the truth is more interesting than fiction. The “Anyone But You” star’s denim-focused advertisement announcement helped drum up interest on the popular Wall Street Bets Reddit page, sending the stock soaring overnight and into Thursday’s session. With that action, the clothing retailer earned a place in the new cohort of meme stocks — including GoPro, Krispy Kreme and Kohl’s — that have seen wild trading this week. — CNBC’s Kevin Breuninger, Sean Conlon, Kif Leswing and Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

Text: - As tech giants including [Microsoft](https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/), [IBM](https://fortune.com/company/ibm/), and [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) shed thousands of workers, experts weigh in on the motivations behind the layoffs.

Six months into 2025, the tech industry has seen thousands of layoffs as giants such as Microsoft, Google, [Meta](https://fortune.com/company/facebook/), IBM, PwC, and Chegg Inc. make sweeping cuts.

While AI replacing humans is often cited as the culprit, experts say the reality is more complex: these companies are freeing up capital to hire AI instead **_._** It may seem like a neat distinction—and will undoubtedly be cold comfort to those who lost their jobs—but these experts say that these companies need the funds to make big bets on AI. In part, they’re hiring a new workforce. The tech CEOs who are making the layoff decisions are largely offering a darker worldview, confirming that automation is coming for the white-collar workforce.

## **Microsoft**‘s AI ambitions

Microsoft has been at the center of this year’s layoff wave, letting go of nearly 6,000 employees in May, followed by [another 9,000 in July](https://fortune.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-layoffs-9000-ai/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks)—amounting to almost 4% of its global workforce.

CEO Satya Nadella has openly discussed the company’s AI transformation, revealing that AI now writes [20% to 30% of Microsoft’s code](https://fortune.com/2025/07/02/ai-work-salesforce-benioff-nadella-microsoft-pichai-google/). This shift has sparked debate about the future need for human engineers, as the company reallocates resources to fund an [$80 billion AI infrastructure](https://fortune.com/article/microsofts-q3-quarterly-earnings-beat-shows-no-sign-of-ai-disillusionment-or-trump-tariff-impact/) push this year.

## **Financial strategy and restructuring**

Industry experts like [Deedy Das of Menlo Ventures](https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/menlo-ventures-generative-ai-vc-strategy-19626994.htm) argue that the layoffs are less about AI replacing workers and more about freeing up capital for AI investments.

Tech commentator Wes Roth [echoed the sentiment](https://x.com/WesRothMoney/status/1922426917090975829): “This isn’t about AI replacing humans yet—it’s about restructuring to fund AI initiatives.” Microsoft’s approach is mirrored across the sector, with companies including [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) [flattening management layers](https://fortune.com/2025/03/04/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-middle-managers-rto-gen-z/) and prioritizing technical roles over administrative ones.

Das and Roth did not respond to requests for comment.

IBM has cut around 8,000 jobs in HR and other departments, as AI tools take over routine administrative tasks. However, the company is simultaneously hiring more engineers and salespeople, signaling a shift toward roles that require creativity and complex decision-making.

Google and Meta have also made significant cuts, with Meta laying off 3,600 employees at the start of the year and [Google reducing](https://www.thestreet.com/employment/google-sends-a-harsh-message-to-employees-after-layoffs) hundreds of roles in its Android, Pixel, and Chrome teams. Both companies cite the need to streamline operations and [invest in AI](https://fortune.com/2025/07/11/how-much-ai-salary-meta-zuckerberg-200-million-compensation/) as key reasons.

PwC and Chegg Inc. have joined the layoff trend, with PwC [cutting approximately](https://fortune.com/2025/05/15/pwc-cut-1500-jobs-shows-mini-boom-accounting-ending/) 1,500 jobs and Chegg [reducing its workforce](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chegg-lay-off-22-workforce-ai-tools-shake-up-edtech-industry-2025-05-12/) by 22% as students increasingly turn to free AI-powered study tools.

## What they’re saying

As AI becomes more central to business operations, tech companies are redefining what productivity means. Tech CEOs and thought leaders have been outspoken this year about how AI is reshaping their sector with the unambiguous message that at least some jobs are being fundamentally displaced. There is still a debate about whether they are being eliminated for good.

Meta’s [Mark Zuckerberg](https://fortune.com/2025/01/24/mark-zuckerberg-ai-engineer-capex-spend/) said AI could be ready this year to “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer,” capable of writing code. [Andy Jassy](https://fortune.com/2025/07/01/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-fewer-jobs/) said Amazon “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” while Ford’s [Jim Farley](https://fortune.com/2025/07/05/ford-ceo-jim-farley-ai-white-collar-jobs-essential-economy-skilled-trade-jobs-shortage/) and Anthropic’s [Dario Amodei](https://fortune.com/2025/05/28/anthropic-ceo-warning-ai-job-loss/) separately predicted that AI is set to displace essentially half of all white-collar positions.

It’s not all doomsday predictions. [Bill Gates](https://www.google.com/search?q=bill+gates+free+intelligence+fortune.com&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1169US1169&oq=bill+gates+free+intelligence+fortune.com&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigAdIBCDM5MzdqMGo0qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) see an era of “ [free intelligence](https://www.google.com/search?q=bill+gates+free+intelligence&sca_esv=0e39c597175f10a4&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1169US1169&sxsrf=AE3TifMWNhmbSEKzYrUzMDaezioieqJb7Q%3A1752680821064&ei=dcl3aLLTA9ue5NoP1PTfkQ0&ved=0ahUKEwjy4fnt3MGOAxVbD1kFHVT6N9IQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=bill+gates+free+intelligence&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiHGJpbGwgZ2F0ZXMgZnJlZSBpbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UyBBAjGCcyBRAAGIAEMgsQABiABBiGAxiKBTILEAAYgAQYhgMYigUyBRAAGO8FMggQABiiBBiJBTIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGKIEGIkFSIUGUJMEWJMEcAJ4AJABAJgBbKABzAGqAQMxLjG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgOgAn7CAgsQABiABBiwAxiiBMICCxAAGLADGKIEGIkFwgIIEAAYsAMY7wWYAwCIBgGQBgSSBwMyLjGgB6wJsgcDMC4xuAd3wgcHMC4xLjEuMcgHDg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)” coming as AI will become capable of handling most tasks. Nvidia’s [Jensen Huang](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/13/business/video/gps0713-ai-workforce-nvidia-productivity) said AI will “change everyone’s job — it’s changed mine.” The thousands of tech workers that have been laid off so far in 2025 are watching and waiting.

Text: **The global technology landscape** is undergoing significant shifts, propelled by fast-moving innovations in technologies. These are exponentially increasing demand for computing power, capturing the attention of management teams and the public, and accelerating experimentation. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of rising global competition as countries and corporations race to secure leadership in producing and applying these strategic technologies.

This year’s McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook provides in-depth perspectives on 13—a “baker’s dozen”—frontier technology trends with the potential to transform global business. Executives today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world where the lines between digital and physical and centralized and decentralized continue to blur. The insights in this report can help business leaders decide which of these frontier technologies are most relevant to their companies by demonstrating how others are starting to apply them today. These findings emerge from our analysis of quantitative measures of interest, innovation, equity investment, and talent that underpin each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions around them. (For more about our research, please see the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)

This outlook highlights transformative trends that are driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, as AI both accelerates progress within individual domains and unlocks new possibilities at the intersections—accelerating the training of robots, advancing scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines aspects of trends we previously analyzed separately as applied AI and generative AI, so this year, they are examined together.

Even as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI’s full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike.

## New and notable

In addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year’s report is [agentic AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage), which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating “virtual coworkers” that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year’s trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities.

AI is also the primary catalyst for another trend we highlight this year: application-specific semiconductors. While [Moore’s Law](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-innovation-revolution-powered-by-ai) and the semiconductor layer of the technology stack have long been key enablers of other tech trends, innovations in semiconductors have spiked as reflected in quantitative metrics such as number of patents. These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption. This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems.

Technology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function—and thus lots of innovation and interest—and it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical. Other trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches—from watchful waiting to aggressive deployment—to business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions.

From the rise of robotics and autonomous systems to the imperative for responsible AI innovations, this year’s technology developments underscore a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and integral to solving global problems. This is illuminated by themes that cut across trends this year:

- _The rise of autonomous systems._ Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. These systems aren’t just executing tasks; they’re starting to learn, adapt, and collaborate. Autonomy is moving toward broad deployment, whether through coordinating last-mile logistics, navigating dynamic environments, or acting as virtual coworkers, among other skills.
- _New human–machine collaboration models._ Human–machine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. From immersive training environments and haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and sensor-enabled wearables, technology is becoming more responsive to human intent and behavior. This evolution is shifting the narrative [from human replacement to augmentation](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/keeping-artificial-intelligence-real)—enabling more natural, productive collaboration between people and intelligent systems. As machines get better at interpreting context, the boundary between operator and cocreator continues to dissolve.
- _Scaling challenges._ The surging demand for compute-intensive workloads, especially from gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments, is creating new demands on global infrastructure. Data center power constraints, physical network vulnerabilities, and rising compute demands have exposed cracks in global infrastructure. But the challenge isn’t just technical: Supply chain delays, labor shortages, and regulatory friction around grid access and permitting are slowing deployments. As a result, scaling now means solving not only for technical architecture and efficient design but also for the messy, real-world challenges in talent, policy, and execution.
- _Regional and national competition._ Global competition over critical technologies has intensified. Countries and corporations have doubled down on sovereign infrastructure, localized chip fabrication, and funding technology initiatives such as quantum labs. This push for self-sufficiency isn’t just about security; it’s about reducing exposure to geopolitical risk and owning the next wave of value creation. The result is a new era of tech-driven competition where nations have a stake in critical industries.
- _Scale and specialization are growing simultaneously._ Growth on these vectors is enabled by innovation in cloud services and advanced connectivity. On one hand, we see rapid growth in general-purpose model training infrastructure in vast, power-hungry data centers, while on the other, we observe accelerating innovation “at the edge,” with lower-power technology embedded in phones, cars, home controls, and industrial devices. This is creating ecosystems that deliver massive large language models with staggering parameter counts, as well as a growing range of domain-specific AI tools that can run almost anywhere. Leaders will balance centralized scale with localized control: Think modular microgrids for clean energy or bespoke robotics for niche manufacturing.
- _Responsible innovation imperatives._ As technologies become more powerful and more personal, trust is increasingly the gatekeeper to adoption. Companies face growing pressure to demonstrate transparency, fairness, and accountability, whether in AI models, gene editing pipelines, or immersive platforms. Ethics are no longer just the right thing to do but rather strategic levers in deployment that can accelerate—or stall—scaling, investment, and long-term impact.

The following illustrations show how different frontier technologies can work together to provide innovative solutions in the future:

After a year in which the macroeconomic environment and broader market weakness provoked significant declines in equity financing for technology across several of our trends, the investment climate for frontier technologies stabilized and, in many cases, rebounded in 2024. Levels of equity investment in trends such as cloud and edge computing, bioengineering, and space technologies increased despite the broader market dip in 2023, while investments in other trends, such as AI and robotics, dipped only to recover to higher levels in 2024 than they achieved two years prior. The two trends with the highest levels of equity investment, the future of energy and sustainability technologies and the future of mobility, declined overall in 2023, but the former bounced back in 2024 (exhibit).

Our baker’s dozen of technology trends shaping 2025 underscores the vast potential of emerging technologies and the need for strategic alignment in an AI-powered future. For executives, success will hinge on identifying high-impact domains in which they can apply these trends, investing in the necessary talent and infrastructure, and addressing external factors like regulatory shifts and ecosystem readiness. By fostering collaboration, bridging ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term vision, leaders can accelerate adoption and position their organizations to drive the next wave of technological transformation. Those who act with focus and agility will not only unlock new value but also shape the future of their industries and the future of today’s emerging frontier technologies.

Text: ## TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services on Sunday said that it will reduce its workforce by 2%, adding that the transition is being planned with due care.

Tata Consultancy Services on Sunday said that it will reduce its workforce by 2% or around 12,000 jobs from its global workforce. **(Bloomberg)**

TCS layoffs: India’s largest software services provider Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will reduce its workforce by 2% or roughly over 12,000 employees in its 2026 financial year.

The company is retraining and redeploying staff in a bid to become more agile and future ready amid rapid disruptions in technology, particularly around Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Mid to senior ranks in focus

The company’s decision is primarily targeted at the middle and senior management, reported _Reuters_.

This decision will impact employees from different countries and domains where TCS operates.

TCS has an employee headcount of 6,13,000 for the latest quarter ended June.

TCS assured that this transition is being planned with “due care” to ensure no disruption in delivering service to the clients.

In the April-June quarter, TCS's operating margins narrowed 20 basis points to 24.5%, amid the company's plans to boost them to 26-28% levels.

Just two weeks ago, TCS also said that their ‘priority’ focus is delivering wage hikes for its over 6 lakh workforce.

“My priority is getting back to the wage hike,” said Chief Financial Officer (CFO) [Samir Seksaria](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-salary-hike-it-major-says-wage-hikes-to-6-lakh-employees-a-priority-heres-what-cfo-says-11752415737293.html) without specifying a deadline for the salary hike for its employees.

## The company’s attrition rate

[TCS employee attrition](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-salary-hike-it-major-says-wage-hikes-to-6-lakh-employees-a-priority-heres-what-cfo-says-11752415737293.html) rate climbed 13.8% on a last twelve-month (LTM) basis as of the end of the April to June quarter of FY2025-26. This marked a marginal rise on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, compared to its 13.3% levels in the January-March quarter of FY 2024-25.

The company's CFO said that with the attrition rate hitting a ‘concerning level’ as of the April-June quarter, the company will now focus on retaining top-level talent, which is difficult to build through fresh hiring.

He also hinted that as the company has capacity now, it may go slow on lateral hirings and restart once the demand surges, according to the agency report.

Synopsis

## The U.S. West Coast has always been the main destination for ambitious software engineers looking to work in the best-paid, most elite corner of their profession, but the mass redundancies have created a pool of jobseekers that Germany is eager to tap.

Faced with a tight labour market and a shortage of workers with key software engineering skills, some German companies are looking at thousands of [layoffs](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/layoffs) in [Silicon Valley](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/silicon-valley) as an opportunity to recruit top talent.

The U.S. West Coast has always been the main destination for ambitious software engineers looking to work in the best-paid, most elite corner of their profession, but the mass redundancies have created a pool of jobseekers that [Germany](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/germany) is eager to tap.

"They fire, we hire," said Rainer Zugehoer, Chief People Officer at Cariad, the software subsidiary of automaker Volkswagen. "We have several hundred open positions in the U.S., in Europe and in China."

Spooked by inflation and the prospect of recession, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook owner Meta have announced a combined almost 40,000 [job cuts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/job-cuts).

While Germany is also teetering on the edge of recession, its companies have grown more slowly in recent years and, in a country notorious for still handling business by fax, there are huge technology leaps to be made.

Germany to make it easier for Indians to move for education, jobs](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/germany-to-make-it-easier-for-indians-to-move-for-education-jobs/articleshow/95992640.cms)

Germany, with one of the world's oldest populations, has gaping holes in its labour force: according to IT industry group Bitkom, 137,000 IT [jobs](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/jobs) are unfilled.

The government is simplifying immigration rules and dangling the prospect of easily-acquired citizenship to tempt skilled would-be immigrants, and regional authorities are pressing ahead.

"I would like to cordially invite you to move to Bavaria," wrote Judith Gerlach, digitalisation minister in Germany's wealthiest region on LinkedIn in a post addressed to the recently laid off.

Especially with the euro at dollar parity, few European companies pay rates that compete with the hundreds of thousands of dollars on offer at California's most successful companies, but some hope cheaper healthcare and lower costs compared to hotspots like San Francisco can help.

"And did I mention Oktoberfest?" Gerlach added, adding Munich's famed beer festival to the strong labour protections that might prove attractive to the newly jobless.

Some are sceptical, with Bitkom's Bernhard Rohleder noting that Germany is competing not just with other countries for the most talented, but with potential recruits' home countries too.

Germany's penchant for red tape could be another challenge: companies are already reporting months-long delays in securing appointments for their new hires to get work permits.

"Bureaucracy in Germany is utterly crippling for most highly-qualified workers when they first encounter it, especially if they don't speak German," said Diana Stoleru of Berlin startup Lendis.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar.  On July 17, JPMorgan reiterated the stock as “Overweight” and raised its price target on Apple to $250 per share from $230. “We rate shares of Apple Overweight from the combination of AI and age of installed base led volume replacement cycle while Services continues to demonstrate robust growth delivering acceleration in earnings growth.” In other news, Bloomberg reported that after Meta poached one of Apple’s top artificial intelligence executives with a $200 million package, it has hired two of his subordinates too. Apple’s Mark Lee and Tom Gunter will now be joining the newly formed Superintelligence Labs team at Meta. JPMorgan Bumps Apple (AAPL) PT to $250, Keeps ‘Overweight’ Pixabay/Public Domain Meta has been spending heavily to keep up in the AI race, particularly to keep up with advancements from tech giants such as OpenAI and Google. Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, particularly the iPhones and MacBooks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Tracking Closely. On July 21, Morgan Stanley reiterated the stock as “Overweight,” noting that it’s sticking with Apple shares ahead of a solid quarter. The firm believes that strong iPhone, iPad, Mac sales, and favorable FX will lead Apple toward a robust quarter, and that its guidance will likely align with expectations. However, for the sentiment to improve, clarity on tariffs, the Alphabet ruling, and AI strategy is still required. Investors shouldn’t be hoping for any meaningful updates in terms of artificial intelligence in the quarter. The firm is of the view that investors don’t appreciate Apple’s AI efforts, particularly because it is in continuous comparison with Google, Meta, and Amazon’s work. Apple (AAPL) Analysts Stay Positive Ahead of Earnings, But AI Clarity Still Needed Stock market reports printed on a sheet of paper. Photo by RDNE Stock Project on Pexels “Our estimates are moving higher, but we still need key overhangs to dissipate before getting more structurally bullish.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

## Apple reportedly looking at acquiring Perplexity AI

According to a recent report from Bloomberg, Apple is contemplating the purchase of Perplexity AI. The company's chatbot is one of many popular alternatives to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Perplexity AI is focused on developing a chatbot designed as an answer engine, prioritizing real-time web search and accurate, cited answers. There are an estimated 15 million active monthly users on Perplexity. While that puts it nowhere near ChatGPT, which averages 400 million users each week, Perplexity has become one of the prominent chatbots out there, and it has been growing in popularity.

The move can potentially make a lot of sense for both Apple and Perplexity, with the AI company being worth around $14 billion, based on a recent funding round. For Apple, while that would be a big acquisition, it wouldn't be hard to fund the deal; as of the end of March, the tech giant had more than $28 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its books. For Perplexity, having a company with deep pockets to help fund its growth could help it to better compete against ChatGPT and other chatbots.

## Why a big AI acquisition may not necessarily solve Apple's problems

An acquisition of Perplexity AI or another similar AI company would instantly enhance Apple's capabilities. Apple would be less dependent on other chatbots if it had one of its own. And it would acquire the AI talent it needs to position itself for greater AI-related growth opportunities in the future.

But the big problem may come from higher up, with Apple's management taking a conservative approach to AI and focusing on security and privacy over speed. Perplexity has run into problems with copyright infringement, which could lead to costly legal bills and may lead to the need for safeguards.

Plus, the core issue at hand is incorporating advanced AI features into Apple's iPhones, not necessarily the company having its own chatbot. Apple has delayed some AI features for its iPhones until next year. And without next-gen features, customers may see little reason to upgrade their iPhones. iPhone sales over the past six months have essentially been flat year over year at around $116 billion.

## Is Apple a good buy right now?

Apple hasn't announced a deal to acquire Perplexity, and there is no reason to believe that an acquisition is imminent. But I do believe that Apple, with its massive stockpile of cash, can dig itself out of its current hole. One big acquisition could transform its growth prospects, though it may not be a quick or easy fix.

And with the stock trading at 31 times its trailing earnings, I don't think it's cheap enough to buy given its struggles and limited growth of late. I would want more of a discount before buying the stock to ensure a bigger margin of safety.

## Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?

Text: Apple stock is down 15% year to date, but most Wall Street analysts are optimistic ahead of the company's upcoming earnings report.

**Apple**( [AAPL](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) 0.07%) is no longer the most valuable company in the world. It ceded the title to **Microsoft** in May, then slipped behind **Nvidia** in June. Apple stock has dropped 15% year to date over concerns about tariffs and its artificial intelligence strategy.

Nevertheless, most Wall Street analysts rate Apple stock a buy ahead of its third-quarter financial report, which is due after market close on Thursday, July 31. Among 51 analysts, the median target price is $236 per share, which implies 10% upside from the current share price of $214.

Here's what investors should know.

## Apple is beset by headwinds related to tariffs and artificial intelligence

Apple consistently leads the market in smartphone revenue, but the company also captured the top spot in smartphone shipments in the March quarter. Nevertheless, Apple still reported unimpressive financial results. Revenue rose 5% to $95 billion and [GAAP](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/generally-accepted-accounting-principles/) net income rose 5% to $24.8 billion.

Tariffs are a potential problem. **Jefferies** analyst Edison Lee says import taxes could be a 7% headwind to earnings, assuming the U.S. imposes a 10% tariff on India, a 20% tariff on Vietnam, and a 30% tariff on China. But that creates downside risk. President Trump has announced a deal with Vietnam but has not secured long-term deals with India or China.

Beyond tariffs, investors are concerned about Apple's [artificial intelligence](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/) (AI) strategy or lack thereof. Many analysts touted generative AI capabilities added with Apple Intelligence as the catalyst for a major iPhone upgrade cycle, but consumers have been unimpressed. The company has also repeatedly delayed promised AI upgrades for Siri.

In addition, many analysts assumed Apple would eventually launch a paid version of Apple Intelligence with premium AI features, but the company has yet to make any such announcements. So the question remains: How will Apple monetize artificial intelligence?

Elsewhere, Apple could lose a substantial amount of services revenue depending on the outcome of an antitrust lawsuit involving **Alphabet**. To elaborate, a federal judge last year ruled against Alphabet, finding the company had an illegal monopoly in internet search. One remedy would be prohibiting or limiting its ability to pay Apple for default search placement on the Safari browser. That could cost Apple in excess of $20 billion per year.

## What Wall Street expects from Apple in its upcoming earnings report

Apple will announce financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in June, after the stock market closes on Thursday, July 31. Forecasts from Wall Street set a relatively low bar for the company. These are the consensus estimates:

- Revenue will increase 3.6% to $88.9 billion.
- Earnings will increase 1.4% to $1.42 per diluted share.

Importantly, Apple topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 2.5% over the \[past four quarters, but shares still fell by an average of 1.2% after the past four reports. That means beating estimates is not sufficient to send the stock higher. Instead, price action following the report is likely to depend on commentary about tariffs and AI.

Finally, pricing data from options contracts currently implies a 3.5% post-earnings move. In that scenario, the stock would close between $207 and $222 on the day after the report.

## Apple stock is still expensive despite falling 15% year to date

Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to grow at 6% annually through the fiscal year ending in September 2026. That makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look expensive. That gives a [price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/p/peg-ratio/) above 5. Traditionally, stocks with PEG ratios above 3 are considered overvalued.

Apple introduced in the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2015, and AirPods in 2017. But the company has now failed to develop a groundbreaking new product for seven-plus years. Does that mean Apple has lost its ability to innovate? Without a new catalyst, be it artificial intelligence or something else, I doubt Apple stock can move sustainably higher from its current price.

Text: 
 A Wall Street analyst urges caution on Apple ( AAPL) stock because of the company's lack of a clear strategy for artificial intelligence, including generative AI. 
 Needham analyst Laura Martin said Apple risks falling too far behind Big Tech rivals to catch up in AI if it doesn't get its act together.

 "Apple must articulate a GenAI action plan," Martin said in a client note Friday. "Apple is 1-2 years behind its Big Tech competitors, so any GenAI plan will be expensive to catch up through higher costs to the P&amp;L and higher capex, and maybe even an acquisition." 
 Further, if it doesn't act, tech talent will leave Apple to work for big players in artificial intelligence such as Meta Platforms ( META), OpenAI, Anthropic and others, she said. 
 Also, Apple iPhone users might switch to handsets running Google Android software if Alphabet 's ( GOOGL) Google gets too far ahead in AI technology. 
 Martin rates Apple stock as hold, or neutral. 
 "We believe that Apple's share price will fall once investors understand the investment levels required to catch up with the other Big Tech conglomerates that were early adopters of GenAI," Martin said. 
 Cook On The Chopping Block? 
 Lack of a clear AI strategy could even cost Chief Executive Tim Cook his job, she said. 
 "Press and Wall Street's calls to replace Tim Cook as Apple CEO are getting louder every quarter that Apple doesn't lay out a comprehensive GenAI strategy," Martin said. "With Apple shares down 14% year to date (vs S&amp;P 500 up 8%), it's clear to us that investors are insisting that Apple get off the sidelines." 
 However, if Apple makes a costly move to invest heavily in AI, it will be a shock to investors, she said. 
 Potential shocks would include Apple raising its capex from $12 billion in fiscal 2025 to $30 billion to $50 billion a year to invest in AI data centers, she said. Or it could make a multibillion-dollar acquisition, such as the rumored purchase of Perplexity AI, valued at $14 billion. 
 Apple Stock Faces Overhangs 
 Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said sentiment won't materially shift on Apple stock until investors get clarity not only on the company's AI strategy but also tariffs and the pending Department of Justice ruling on Apple's search engine deal with Google. 
 Woodring rates Apple stock as overweight, or buy, with a price target of 235. 
 On the stock market today, Apple stock rose a fraction to close at 213.88. 
 "We still need key overhangs to dissipate before getting more structurally bullish," Woodring said in a client note Monday. 
 Apple is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday.

Text: People look at iPhones at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York City on May 23, 2025.

Adam Gray \| Reuters

[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) and miner [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/) [announced](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-and-apple-announce-500-million-partnership-to-produce-recycled-rare-earth-magnets-in-the-united-states) a [$500 million deal](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-expands-us-supply-chain-with-500-million-usd-commitment/) Tuesday for rare earth magnets and the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker’s U.S. supply chain.

MP Materials stock climbed 20%. Shares of Apple were marginally higher.

As part of the agreement, Apple will buy rare earth magnets created at the company’s facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Both companies will combine on a new rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. MP Materials plans to start shipping magnets in 2027.

“American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.”.

Apple said the deal will create dozens of new manufacturing and research and development roles.

Rare earth magnets are key components that make up everything from consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers to cars and renewable energy systems.

For years, the U.S. has worked on curbing its reliance on China, which [dominates](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) the global rare earth elements supply chain. MP Materials operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S.

Earlier this month, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in the rare earth miner, [buying $400 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html) in preferred stock to improve rare earth magnet supply on American soil.

Apple announced a plan to [invest more than $500 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/24/apples-plan-to-invest-500-billion-in-th-u-s.html) to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities earlier this year. The plan included a [new factory](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/apple-to-open-texas-ai-server-factory-in-500-billion-us-expansion.html) for artificial intelligence servers in Texas.

Shares of MP Materials have nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, pushing the miner’s market capitalization to nearly $10 billion. The stock has nearly doubled over the last month.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc Tim Cook-by John Gress Media Inc via Shutterstock With a year-to-date loss of 15%, Apple (AAPL) is the second-worst performing “Magnificent 7” stock this year. Only Tesla (TSLA) has fared worse than Apple among the coveted group, thanks to news flow around CEO Elon Musk’s politics, which often tend to overshadow the more pressing issues that the company needs to address. As for Apple, the YTD underperformance comes amid the growing perception that it slacked big time on artificial intelligence (AI). As Wedbush analyst Dan Ives aptly said, “Apple is at a highway rest stop on a bench watching this Fourth Industrial Revolution race go by at 100 miles an hour.” It’s Never ‘Happened in the History of Tech to Any Company Before’: OpenAI’s Sam Altman Says ChatGPT is Growing at an Unprecedented Rate This Penny Stock Wants to Become the MicroStrategy of Dogecoin Option Volatility And Earnings Report For July 21 - 25 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now! Some other headlines are even more unforgiving, with one even claiming Apple stock is for “losers.” That said, the iPhone maker remains the largest holding for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), and the “Oracle of Omaha” does not appear to be in a mood to sell more shares after trimming the holdings to a round figure of 300 million shares. In this article, we’ll gauge how bad things are for Apple, as a section of the market questions whether CEO Tim Cook is the best person to lead the Cupertino-based company amid its recent underperformance. www.barchart.com While other Big Tech companies have ramped up their AI capex, filling up Nvidia’s (NVDA) coffers in that process, Apple hasn’t seen a commensurate rise in its AI spending. The company’s “Apple Intelligence” features have been quite gradual, and while Apple maintains that iPhone sales have been better in regions where these features are available, they haven’t moved the needle much, or at least that’s what the sales numbers tell us. The argument about Apple slacking on its AI initiatives gained momentum following last month’s WWDC, where the new features were not exactly groundbreaking and, in many cases, Apple appeared to be playing catch-up with its competitors. For example, despite Siri having the first-mover advantage in the digital assistant space, it is still well behind AI assistants offered by the likes of OpenAI. There have been rumours about Apple considering acquiring AI startup Perplexity. However, I believe the possibility of that acquisition looks dim as, firstly, Apple has historically not made large acquisitions. Plus, it has prioritized privacy in its AI development, unlike Perplexity.

Text: **Apple Inc.** AAPL has had a bruising start to 2025, with its stock down about 18% year-to-date and underperforming the broader stock market by 22%—its worst [half-year stretch since 2013.](https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/25/05/45675595/apple-eyes-worst-month-vs-sp-500-since-2018-but-history-says-buy-the-dip-now)

But as July kicks off, investors may find a surprisingly bullish signal in an unexpected place: the calendar.

### Why Has Apple Struggled So Much In 2025?

The first half of the year was defined by a perfect storm for Apple—trade tensions, delays in product innovation and a growing AI gap all chipped away at investor confidence.

One of the biggest headwinds came from President **Donald Trump**‘s renewed tariff agenda. In 2024, Apple generated 64% of its total revenue from overseas, with Greater China and Europe being among its most profitable regions. But in early 2025, trade-related uncertainty soured consumer sentiment abroad, especially in China.

The numbers confirm it: in the first quarter of 2025, Apple's revenue from Greater China dropped 13% year-over-year to $16.37 billion, down from $18.25 billion during the same quarter of 2024. Local rivals, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, gained market share, while demand for iPhones softened.

Then came Apple's AI problem. While **Microsoft Corp.** MSFT, **Alphabet Inc.** GOOGL, and **Nvidia Corp.** NVDA captured market buzz with new AI-driven features and products, Apple offered few details.

With no firm AI roadmap and delays around the iPhone 17 and the Vision Pro international rollout, many investors began rotating out of Apple into higher-growth tech names like **Nvidia**, **Palantir Technologies Inc**. PLTR **Meta Platforms Inc**. META and **Broadcom Inc.** AVGO

### Can Apple Turn Things Around In July?

On the surface, Apple seems out of favor. But dig into the seasonality, and July could offer the kind of bullish argument that flips the narrative.

Apple's seasonal gains in July are unmatched. Over the past 20 years, the stock has ended July higher 17 times, with an average return of 7.6%.

Even more impressive, Apple is riding a 9-year winning streak in July. The best performances came in 2022 (+18.9%) and 2006 (+18.6%).

Expand the scope to 30 years, and the signal remains intact: Apple averaged a 7.3% gain in July, with a 77% win rate (23 positive closes out of 30).

The biggest drawdowns occurred in 2001 (-19.2%), 2002 (-13.9%), and 2008 (-5.1%)—but those were years defined by broader market crises.

More recently, pullbacks have been minor, like -3.3% in 2015 or -0.6% in 2004.

Apple's relative performance versus the S&P 500 in July has been positive in 77% of the past 30 years, with an average outperformance of 5.8%.

No other S&P 500 stock has matched that consistency or magnitude over the same period.

In short, Apple hasn't just risen in July—it's crushed the market in July, time and time again. And with sentiment scraping cycle lows in 2025, history suggests July has often been Apple's golden window for a rebound.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft CEO makes bold statement on company's future originally appeared on TheStreet. In a candid memo released July 24, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed what he called the issue "weighing heavily" on him: the company’s ongoing layoffs. More than 15,000 Microsoft employees have been let go in 2025 alone, as part of what Nadella described as a necessary but painful restructuring in the age of AI. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰 The company also cut nearly 2,000 additional staff deemed "low performers" earlier this year. "I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations," he wrote. Related: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that ChatGPT is not the way to superintelligence Recall Nadella wrote a similar note in 2023 — shortly after the company paused raises and announced its first significant layoffs of the post-pandemic era. He faced criticism at the time for placing too much focus on the company's outperformance without acknowledging those difficult moves. Despite the cuts, investors have rewarded Microsoft’s leaner operating model. The company’s stock closed above $500 for the first time on July 9, a symbolic milestone that arguably underscores Wall Street’s growing faith in Microsoft’s AI strategy. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes technology progress isn't linear. Image source: Ben Kriemann/Getty Images In his July memo, Nadella used stark language to describe the current environment, stating: "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." "Progress isn't linear," he added. "It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before." For the past decade, Microsoft  ( MSFT)  has operated under a unifying purpose: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. But Nadella says that vision now needs to evolve. Related: Analysts unveil bold Amazon stock price target before earnings "We must reimagine our mission for a new era," he wrote. "What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools." This shift reflects the company’s broader transformation from a software-centric business to what Nadella calls an "intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve." Microsoft's strategy hinges on positioning itself at the center of the AI value chain. Its Azure cloud platform is rapidly becoming the infrastructure of choice for AI workloads. OpenAI, as well as other major AI labs and enterprises, use Microsoft's GPU-centric cloud services to train and deploy large models.

Text: Microsoft has conducted 15,000 layoffs and job suspensions this year alone. The Redmond-based tech giant is undergoing a significant transformation. According to a report by The Verge, Microsoft is [boosting AI investments by laying off thousands](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/709144/microsoft-layoffs-2025-ai-notepad) of employees. Microsoft isn’t the only company doing this, as Intel also [plans to lay off 24,000](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/intel-slashes-24000-jobs-and-kills-offside-projects-in-massive-shake-up.html) by the end of 2025, as it’s also boosting AI investments.

## Microsoft’s 2025 layoffs to expand AI investment have affected many departments

As per The Verge’s Tom Warren, Microsoft’s leadership team had a choice between either reducing investment in [AI](https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/tech-news/artificial-intelligence) infrastructure or laying off employees and deeply cutting operating expenses. It’s quite clear which route Microsoft chose. This year’s layoffs have affected thousands of Microsoft employees across departments, including sales, marketing, and management.

While the company has relocated some employees, the massive scale of job reductions underscores Microsoft’s clear choice of [prioritizing AI investment over maintaining](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106507/report-microsoft-chose-to-lay-off-thousands-in-favor-of-ai-investment/index.html) existing staff levels. The decision has also impacted the company’s Xbox gaming division. The brand has already cancelled several games, laid off gaming division employees, and shut down various studios.

[Microsoft’s layoffs](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/microsoft-cuts-thousands-of-jobs-as-ai-takes-the-wheel.html) come at a time when many game companies are betting big on AI investments. Companies like Sony and EA have invested heavily in AI, with the latter having over 100 projects in development. Microsoft is also pushing its MUSE generative AI tech, which can create gameplay in real-time without the requirement of any coding or development tools.

Furthermore, the report suggests that Microsoft has let go of technical specialists, business experts, and product managers. The layoffs have hit the company’s sales team, which is responsible for driving business for its latest technology, hard. It’s clear that the massive lay off decisions are part of Microsoft’s AI investment strategy.

## The layoffs come at a time when Microsoft is enjoying strong financial performance

It’s worth mentioning that Microsoft is laying off thousands while it is enjoying some strong financial performance. The company has reported nearly $75 billion in net income over the past three financial quarters. Meanwhile, the brand is putting a massive amount of $80 billion into AI infrastructure.

That said, in a memo sent to employees recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has [addressed the recent spike in job cuts](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/microsoft-satya-nadella-memo-layoffs.html) at the company. Nadella acknowledged the concerns, saying, _“Before anything else, I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations.”_

Nadella stated that this move is crucial for the brand’s AI transformation. He emphasized the need for both learning and unlearning. He also thanked departing employees for their contributions.

The tech industry has been reeling from a series of layoffs from big tech companies, and we’re just a few weeks into the second half of the year. According to numbers compiled by [The Bridge Chronicle](https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/jobs/tech-layoffs-2025-intel-microsoft-meta-job-cuts), more than 100,000 have been laid off so far, with Intel the leader, slashing over 12,000 positions [across the globe](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/more-intel-layoffs-are-hitting-this-time-in-israel-company-is-even-considering-dramatic-decision-to-shut-down-fab-28). [Microsoft](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft) follows closely, with 10,000 personnel laid off from several divisions, including cloud, gaming (including game studios), and hardware. Meta has also cut about 8,000 workers despite [offering $100M bonuses for new AI hires](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-says-meta-is-offering-obscene-usd100m-bonuses-to-poach-ai-employees-and-even-bigger-salaries-openai-ceo-says-none-of-our-best-people-decided-to-take-them-up-on-that) and [rapidly building AI data centers](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/meta-plans-multi-gw-data-center-thats-nearly-the-size-of-manhattan-zuckerberg-promises-enormous-ai-splash-as-company-uses-tents-to-try-and-keep-up-with-rate-of-expansion). Other big companies affected by layoffs include Amazon, Google, Salesforce, and Cisco.

Intel had been expected to trim off several positions ever since its [disastrous financial report](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-stock-drops-30-overnight-company-sheds-dollar39-billion-in-market-cap) in August 2024. Its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, undertook a [20% workforce reduction](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-to-announce-a-20-percent-workforce-cut-this-week-report) in April, with its [entire automotive chip division reportedly getting the axe](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-lays-off-hundreds-of-engineers-in-california-including-chip-design-engineers-automotive-chip-division-also-axed) in June. It has also reportedly [reduced the number of fab workers at its Oregon site](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-to-begin-fab-personnel-layoffs-in-mid-july-company-to-reduce-costs-and-refocus-on-engineering-talent) in the same month, and rumors point to [more planned in the coming weeks](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intel-allegedly-planning-more-oregon-layoffs-new-report-says-retreating-operation-could-become-a-liability-to-the-state).

The other companies that laid off thousands of personnel are not suffering from poor financial performance, but changing priorities and technologies are forcing them to pivot. The biggest disruption so far is delivered by AI, with institutions turning towards automation to reduce their workforce. A few CEOs, including [Anthropic’s Dario Amodei](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-cause-up-to-20-percent-unemployment-within-five-years-wipe-out-half-of-all-entry-level-white-collar-jobs) and [Ford’s Jim Farley](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ford-ceo-predicts-half-white-collar-workers-lose-jobs-ai), are warning that artificial intelligence will decimate America’s white collar workforce, but Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says that it all [depends on humanity’s creativity](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jensen-huang-adds-voice-to-those-warning-of-ai-induced-job-losses-but-only-if-the-world-runs-out-of-ideas).

The Bridge Chronicle also says that the massive remote work hiring made by tech companies during and immediately after the Global Pandemic, in anticipation of the massive growth pushed by quarantines, is coming back to bite them. When the world eventually opened up, these expected gains did not materialize, leading to a bloated workforce, with many redundancies in tasks and positions.

Aside from that, global headwinds have also dampened the outlook of several companies. President Trump’s tariffs have resulted in shockwaves across different industries, with tech companies some of the most affected by the changes. There’s also Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine, as well as the China-US trade war. While tech giants continue to invest billions in artificial intelligence and data centers, spending both on infrastructure and people, they’re also cutting back on less profitable ventures, resulting in thousands of layoffs being reported across the industry.

Text: Second-quarter earnings season will kick into high gear this week.

Four of the world’s largest companies—Microsoft ( [MSFT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=MSFT)), Apple ( [AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL)), Amazon ( [AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN)), and Meta ( [META](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=META))—are set to report their results. Artificial intelligence will be the focus for many investors, who will be hoping for updates on companies' investments in the era-defining technology and how they're using it. But trade policy could also get some airtime, especially during Apple’s and Amazon’s calls on Thursday.

Microsoft and Meta kick things off with their reports and earnings calls after the closing bell on Wednesday. Alphabet ( [GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=Googl)) and Tesla ( [TSLA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=tsla)) have already turned in results, so after this week the only Magnificent 7 company left to report will be Nvidia ( [NVDA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=nvda)), in late August.

Here are three questions on investors' minds.

## Are AI Investments Still Ramping Up?

Six months ago, one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street was whether U.S. tech companies were spending too much on artificial intelligence. That issue appears to be settled—or, at least, on the back burner for now.

Alphabet ( [GOOG](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOG)) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast [to $85 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/what-google-parent-alphabet-ai-spending-boost-says-about-big-tech-earnings-next-week-11778236), citing growing demand for cloud computing products and services; that was generally read as a good thing. Google Cloud [grew by more than 30%](https://www.investopedia.com/alphabet-earnings-q2-fy2025-cloud-ai-search-google-youtube-11777671) from the prior year, putting the unit on track to book over $50 billion in revenue within the next year.

Cloud computing competitors Microsoft and Amazon could follow Alphabet's lead. Both companies left their [capex forecasts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) unchanged when they reported [quarterly results three months ago](https://www.investopedia.com/ai-costs-in-focus-ahead-of-tech-earnings-after-meta-s-q1-debacle-8638951), decisions that may have been influenced by the trade and economic uncertainty hanging over the market at the time. The companies could be feeling more confident about boosting AI spending now that some of the fog has been lifted by trade agreements.

Meta was the odd one out last quarter when it raised its capex outlook. It’s not out of the question that the social media giant will lift its forecast again; it did so in the [first](https://www.investopedia.com/meta-q1-fy-2024-earnings-8638311?) and [second](https://www.investopedia.com/meta-q2-fy-2024-earnings-8687033) quarters last year.

## Is AI Leading to Monetization and Efficiency Gains?

Investors will be looking for evidence that big investments in AI are paying off.

“AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum,” said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Executives said on the company’s earnings call that Google is monetizing AI search results at about the same rate as it is traditional search, and that AI overviews are driving increased search volume.

In recent quarters, Meta has convinced Wall Street that AI is improving ad performance and user engagement. Investors are hoping this week’s results continue to demonstrate that Meta's investments are bearing fruit.

Amazon could offer updates on how customers are engaging with Rufus, its AI shopping assistant, and Q, its work assistant. Microsoft is likely to elaborate on the uptake of its Copilot AI offering.

As for Apple, experts say, investors may still have to wait for the details they crave.

“We don't expect (1) an update on Apple Intelligence timing (2026), (2) any material change in quarterly capex, (3) an update on Apple Intelligence approval in China, and/or (4) any new partnership announcements,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in an earnings preview last week. Management might, however, say product sales grew faster in Apple Intelligence-enabled regions than non-AI regions, he said.

## How Are Big Tech Companies Handling Tariffs?

At least in the near term, Apple investors are likely more concerned with tariffs than most of its Magnificent Seven counterparts.

President Donald Trump in April exempted smartphones and other consumer electronics from his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, but the president has ordered his administration to consider invoking national security concerns to impose Section 232 duties on smartphones and semiconductors. [Section 232 tariffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-232-trade-expansion-act.asp) have held up better in court than Trump’s country-specific duties and could be harder for Apple to avoid.

Even with the smartphone exemption, Apple in May estimated tariffs would add $900 million to the company’s costs in the second quarter. Investors will watch for the actual impact and to hear how Apple is engaging with suppliers and the administration to fend off tariffs and mitigate their potential impact.

Trade policy will also be top of mind for Amazon investors. In the first quarter, Amazon saw some evidence buyers were stocking up to get ahead of tariffs, which could set the company up for a sequential slowdown in sales. Executives said merchants didn’t meaningfully increase prices in the first quarter, but noted that could change depending on where tariff rates end up.

Text: **The global technology landscape** is undergoing significant shifts, propelled by fast-moving innovations in technologies. These are exponentially increasing demand for computing power, capturing the attention of management teams and the public, and accelerating experimentation. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of rising global competition as countries and corporations race to secure leadership in producing and applying these strategic technologies.

This year’s McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook provides in-depth perspectives on 13—a “baker’s dozen”—frontier technology trends with the potential to transform global business. Executives today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world where the lines between digital and physical and centralized and decentralized continue to blur. The insights in this report can help business leaders decide which of these frontier technologies are most relevant to their companies by demonstrating how others are starting to apply them today. These findings emerge from our analysis of quantitative measures of interest, innovation, equity investment, and talent that underpin each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions around them. (For more about our research, please see the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)

This outlook highlights transformative trends that are driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, as AI both accelerates progress within individual domains and unlocks new possibilities at the intersections—accelerating the training of robots, advancing scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines aspects of trends we previously analyzed separately as applied AI and generative AI, so this year, they are examined together.

Even as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI’s full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike.

## New and notable

In addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year’s report is [agentic AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage), which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating “virtual coworkers” that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year’s trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities.

AI is also the primary catalyst for another trend we highlight this year: application-specific semiconductors. While [Moore’s Law](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-innovation-revolution-powered-by-ai) and the semiconductor layer of the technology stack have long been key enablers of other tech trends, innovations in semiconductors have spiked as reflected in quantitative metrics such as number of patents. These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption. This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems.

Technology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function—and thus lots of innovation and interest—and it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical. Other trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches—from watchful waiting to aggressive deployment—to business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions.

From the rise of robotics and autonomous systems to the imperative for responsible AI innovations, this year’s technology developments underscore a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and integral to solving global problems. This is illuminated by themes that cut across trends this year:

- _The rise of autonomous systems._ Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. These systems aren’t just executing tasks; they’re starting to learn, adapt, and collaborate. Autonomy is moving toward broad deployment, whether through coordinating last-mile logistics, navigating dynamic environments, or acting as virtual coworkers, among other skills.
- _New human–machine collaboration models._ Human–machine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. From immersive training environments and haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and sensor-enabled wearables, technology is becoming more responsive to human intent and behavior. This evolution is shifting the narrative [from human replacement to augmentation](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/keeping-artificial-intelligence-real)—enabling more natural, productive collaboration between people and intelligent systems. As machines get better at interpreting context, the boundary between operator and cocreator continues to dissolve.
- _Scaling challenges._ The surging demand for compute-intensive workloads, especially from gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments, is creating new demands on global infrastructure. Data center power constraints, physical network vulnerabilities, and rising compute demands have exposed cracks in global infrastructure. But the challenge isn’t just technical: Supply chain delays, labor shortages, and regulatory friction around grid access and permitting are slowing deployments. As a result, scaling now means solving not only for technical architecture and efficient design but also for the messy, real-world challenges in talent, policy, and execution.
- _Regional and national competition._ Global competition over critical technologies has intensified. Countries and corporations have doubled down on sovereign infrastructure, localized chip fabrication, and funding technology initiatives such as quantum labs. This push for self-sufficiency isn’t just about security; it’s about reducing exposure to geopolitical risk and owning the next wave of value creation. The result is a new era of tech-driven competition where nations have a stake in critical industries.
- _Scale and specialization are growing simultaneously._ Growth on these vectors is enabled by innovation in cloud services and advanced connectivity. On one hand, we see rapid growth in general-purpose model training infrastructure in vast, power-hungry data centers, while on the other, we observe accelerating innovation “at the edge,” with lower-power technology embedded in phones, cars, home controls, and industrial devices. This is creating ecosystems that deliver massive large language models with staggering parameter counts, as well as a growing range of domain-specific AI tools that can run almost anywhere. Leaders will balance centralized scale with localized control: Think modular microgrids for clean energy or bespoke robotics for niche manufacturing.
- _Responsible innovation imperatives._ As technologies become more powerful and more personal, trust is increasingly the gatekeeper to adoption. Companies face growing pressure to demonstrate transparency, fairness, and accountability, whether in AI models, gene editing pipelines, or immersive platforms. Ethics are no longer just the right thing to do but rather strategic levers in deployment that can accelerate—or stall—scaling, investment, and long-term impact.

The following illustrations show how different frontier technologies can work together to provide innovative solutions in the future:

After a year in which the macroeconomic environment and broader market weakness provoked significant declines in equity financing for technology across several of our trends, the investment climate for frontier technologies stabilized and, in many cases, rebounded in 2024. Levels of equity investment in trends such as cloud and edge computing, bioengineering, and space technologies increased despite the broader market dip in 2023, while investments in other trends, such as AI and robotics, dipped only to recover to higher levels in 2024 than they achieved two years prior. The two trends with the highest levels of equity investment, the future of energy and sustainability technologies and the future of mobility, declined overall in 2023, but the former bounced back in 2024 (exhibit).

Our baker’s dozen of technology trends shaping 2025 underscores the vast potential of emerging technologies and the need for strategic alignment in an AI-powered future. For executives, success will hinge on identifying high-impact domains in which they can apply these trends, investing in the necessary talent and infrastructure, and addressing external factors like regulatory shifts and ecosystem readiness. By fostering collaboration, bridging ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term vision, leaders can accelerate adoption and position their organizations to drive the next wave of technological transformation. Those who act with focus and agility will not only unlock new value but also shape the future of their industries and the future of today’s emerging frontier technologies.

Text: Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, **AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink**.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

**Where will all of that energy come from?**

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes **as much energy as a small city**. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. **Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.**

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

**One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play.** It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

**The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom**

- It owns critical **nuclear energy infrastructure assets**, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.
- It’s one of the **only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects** across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.
- It plays **a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation**—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy **American** LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth— **collecting fees on every drop exported.**

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be **first in line** to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

**AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.**

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company **powering it all from behind the scenes**.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and **Wall Street is just starting to notice**.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

**This company is completely debt-free.**

In fact, it’s sitting on a **war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap**.

It also owns a **huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play**, giving investors **indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines** without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

**The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out**

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that **some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits**.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because **excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings**.

And that’s for a business tied to:

- The **AI infrastructure supercycle**
- The **onshoring boom** driven by Trump-era tariffs
- A surge in **U.S. LNG exports**
- And a unique footprint in **nuclear energy**—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock **this cheap**… with **this much upside**.

**This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.**

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

**Disruption is the New Name of the Game:** Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

**The Talent Pool is Overflowing:** The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a Must-Watch AI Stock on Wall Street.   On July 11, Citi analyst Atif Malik reiterated the stock as “Buy” with a $240.00 price target. The firm said it sees some uncertainty for Apple but that it’s sticking with its buy rating. Adjusting its iPhone unit sales forecast, the investment bank now anticipates 45 million units in the June quarter, up from its previous estimate of 43 million. Moreover, it expects 50 million units in the September quarter, down from the previous 52 million. Apple (AAPL) $240 PT, Buy — Citi Sees Tariff Boost Now, AI Risks Later A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. The firm attributes June quarter upside largely to tariff pauses and huge discounts in China. However, it remains cautious on full-year iPhone demand based on AI feature delays and Section 232 decisions. “While we acknowledge upside from the pulled forward demand in the Jun-Q driven by tariffs pause and aggressive promotions in China, we remain cautious on the full year iPhone demand given AI delay and pending Section 232 decisions.” While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Tracking Closely. On July 21, Morgan Stanley reiterated the stock as “Overweight,” noting that it’s sticking with Apple shares ahead of a solid quarter. The firm believes that strong iPhone, iPad, Mac sales, and favorable FX will lead Apple toward a robust quarter, and that its guidance will likely align with expectations. However, for the sentiment to improve, clarity on tariffs, the Alphabet ruling, and AI strategy is still required. Investors shouldn’t be hoping for any meaningful updates in terms of artificial intelligence in the quarter. The firm is of the view that investors don’t appreciate Apple’s AI efforts, particularly because it is in continuous comparison with Google, Meta, and Amazon’s work.

Text: NEW YORK, July 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm [**Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9xUPxiWuO7et_h8-ZDfCFpg0p0xz7hxSyd5M6DVtfHWkVFZy-rgwkMT5xXNNZ8sB34Xrs7xPK9ZXernllQeNsguH4f-QJO-KqifBHmB4r0kVFH0pDnFHPSnV54HYGsTbGoX7fdb6z9O9V7PRGpKekan5JBlWJx0ijHlcZE75O5nxu9kBeY2Fr9cLcHnYiL9F) announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in Apple, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: [**https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ixt4c9KOEHXgYxPjyhFxnYe5QkCyhdpfstOR6qqGX46B4g0AQWW4G7KIOH5K4-PZ41-Xev99NfTBacBHtX_SXzP1VCM1_y_XJLN9Qm0xBHqEASEZXyayVOGMWcvhxSztH8BDaDZIdTK_IJNowr2ARrPg9IgN8tlzYPdCIers0NYGmT9unK-Eu3Oouk_mTUUU-PRLyfBgpyoCQUYBoUuZZDmvxGGo6huH3PnC_isHzdw=).

Investors have until August 19, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Apple securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned _Tucker v. Apple Inc., et al._, No. 5:25-cv-05197.

**Why was Apple Sued for Securities Fraud?**

Apple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the businesses of smart-devices and artificial intelligence (“AI”). Apple’s software includes a digital personal assistant called “Siri,” which was first introduced in October 2011. The complaint alleges that Apple misrepresented Siri’s advanced AI-based features as well as its ability to deliver them within the iPhone 16 product cycle.

In truth, as alleged, Apple lacked a functional prototype of Siri’s purported advanced AI-based features and misrepresented the time it would take to integrate such features into its devices.

**The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed**

On March 7, 2025, Apple announced it was indefinitely delaying several AI-based Siri features, citing development delays and pushing their release to sometime “in the coming year.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $11.59 per share, or almost 5%, from $239.07 per share on March 7, 2025, to $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025, the following trading day.

Then, on June 9, 2025, Apple hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference for 2025. Noticeably, Apple failed to announce any new updates regarding advanced Siri features. Analysts and media outlets described the WWDC as “underwhelming” and “disappointing,” with _CNN_ stating that “it’s unlikely that any of the announcements made at Monday’s event will change the perception that Apple is behind its competitors in AI.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $2.47 per share, or over 1%, from $203.92 on June 6, 2025, to $201.45 per share on June 9, 2025, the following trading day.

Text: In This Article: In the first quarter, billionaires David Shaw and Louis Bacon sold Apple and bought O’Reilly Automotive, a stock-split stock up 510% in the last decade. Apple is struggling to incorporate artificial intelligence into its business, and the company has gone seven-plus years without a groundbreaking new product. O'Reilly Automotive could be a winner as President Trump's tariffs encourage consumers to service older vehicles rather than purchasing new ones. 10 stocks we like better than Apple › The hedge fund billionaires listed below sold Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the first quarter and bought O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY), a company whose share price rocketed 510% over the last decade, leading to a 15-for-1 stock split in early June. David Shaw's D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. sold 340,900 shares of Apple, trimming its stake by 6%. The hedge fund also added 19,000 shares of O'Reilly Automotive, though it remains a very small holding. Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management sold 495,800 shares of Apple, cutting its stake 97%. The hedge fund also purchased 240 shares of O'Reilly Automotive, starting a very small position. Importantly, both hedge funds still have exposure to Apple, and neither has an especially large position in O'Reilly Automotive. But investors should still consider both trades for their own portfolios. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Apple has durable brand moat built on design expertise that spans hardware and software. The company once again led the market in smartphone revenue in the March quarter, and it posted double-digit sales growth in its services segment due to strength in advertising, the App Store, and cloud storage. But its overall performance was still uninspiring. Revenue rose 5% to $95 billion, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income climbed 5% to $24.8 billion. Importantly, Apple has struggled to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into its business. Analysts thought the suite of generative AI features added last year (i.e., Apple Intelligence) would catalyze a massive iPhone upgrade cycle, but the consumer response has so far been underwhelming, perhaps because the company has repeatedly delayed highly anticipated AI upgrades to its digital assistant Siri. Apple's failure to monetize AI speaks to a larger problem: The company has seemingly lost its capacity for innovation. After a long stint of very successful product launches -- the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2015, and AirPods in 2017 -- Apple has now gone seven-plus years without a noteworthy new product. And its inability to capitalize on soaring demand for AI is a troubling continuation of that pattern.

Text: People look at iPhones at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York City on May 23, 2025.

Adam Gray \| Reuters

[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) and miner [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/) [announced](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-and-apple-announce-500-million-partnership-to-produce-recycled-rare-earth-magnets-in-the-united-states) a [$500 million deal](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-expands-us-supply-chain-with-500-million-usd-commitment/) Tuesday for rare earth magnets and the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker’s U.S. supply chain.

MP Materials stock climbed 20%. Shares of Apple were marginally higher.

As part of the agreement, Apple will buy rare earth magnets created at the company’s facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Both companies will combine on a new rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. MP Materials plans to start shipping magnets in 2027.

“American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.”.

Apple said the deal will create dozens of new manufacturing and research and development roles.

Rare earth magnets are key components that make up everything from consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers to cars and renewable energy systems.

For years, the U.S. has worked on curbing its reliance on China, which [dominates](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) the global rare earth elements supply chain. MP Materials operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S.

Earlier this month, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in the rare earth miner, [buying $400 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html) in preferred stock to improve rare earth magnet supply on American soil.

Apple announced a plan to [invest more than $500 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/24/apples-plan-to-invest-500-billion-in-th-u-s.html) to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities earlier this year. The plan included a [new factory](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/apple-to-open-texas-ai-server-factory-in-500-billion-us-expansion.html) for artificial intelligence servers in Texas.

Shares of MP Materials have nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, pushing the miner’s market capitalization to nearly $10 billion. The stock has nearly doubled over the last month.

Text: In This Article: Apple Inc Tim Cook-by John Gress Media Inc via Shutterstock With a year-to-date loss of 15%, Apple (AAPL) is the second-worst performing “Magnificent 7” stock this year. Only Tesla (TSLA) has fared worse than Apple among the coveted group, thanks to news flow around CEO Elon Musk’s politics, which often tend to overshadow the more pressing issues that the company needs to address. As for Apple, the YTD underperformance comes amid the growing perception that it slacked big time on artificial intelligence (AI). As Wedbush analyst Dan Ives aptly said, “Apple is at a highway rest stop on a bench watching this Fourth Industrial Revolution race go by at 100 miles an hour.” It’s Never ‘Happened in the History of Tech to Any Company Before’: OpenAI’s Sam Altman Says ChatGPT is Growing at an Unprecedented Rate This Penny Stock Wants to Become the MicroStrategy of Dogecoin Option Volatility And Earnings Report For July 21 - 25 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now! Some other headlines are even more unforgiving, with one even claiming Apple stock is for “losers.” That said, the iPhone maker remains the largest holding for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), and the “Oracle of Omaha” does not appear to be in a mood to sell more shares after trimming the holdings to a round figure of 300 million shares. In this article, we’ll gauge how bad things are for Apple, as a section of the market questions whether CEO Tim Cook is the best person to lead the Cupertino-based company amid its recent underperformance. www.barchart.com While other Big Tech companies have ramped up their AI capex, filling up Nvidia’s (NVDA) coffers in that process, Apple hasn’t seen a commensurate rise in its AI spending. The company’s “Apple Intelligence” features have been quite gradual, and while Apple maintains that iPhone sales have been better in regions where these features are available, they haven’t moved the needle much, or at least that’s what the sales numbers tell us. The argument about Apple slacking on its AI initiatives gained momentum following last month’s WWDC, where the new features were not exactly groundbreaking and, in many cases, Apple appeared to be playing catch-up with its competitors. For example, despite Siri having the first-mover advantage in the digital assistant space, it is still well behind AI assistants offered by the likes of OpenAI. There have been rumours about Apple considering acquiring AI startup Perplexity. However, I believe the possibility of that acquisition looks dim as, firstly, Apple has historically not made large acquisitions. Plus, it has prioritized privacy in its AI development, unlike Perplexity.

Text: **Apple Inc.** AAPL has had a bruising start to 2025, with its stock down about 18% year-to-date and underperforming the broader stock market by 22%—its worst [half-year stretch since 2013.](https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/25/05/45675595/apple-eyes-worst-month-vs-sp-500-since-2018-but-history-says-buy-the-dip-now)

But as July kicks off, investors may find a surprisingly bullish signal in an unexpected place: the calendar.

### Why Has Apple Struggled So Much In 2025?

The first half of the year was defined by a perfect storm for Apple—trade tensions, delays in product innovation and a growing AI gap all chipped away at investor confidence.

One of the biggest headwinds came from President **Donald Trump**‘s renewed tariff agenda. In 2024, Apple generated 64% of its total revenue from overseas, with Greater China and Europe being among its most profitable regions. But in early 2025, trade-related uncertainty soured consumer sentiment abroad, especially in China.

The numbers confirm it: in the first quarter of 2025, Apple's revenue from Greater China dropped 13% year-over-year to $16.37 billion, down from $18.25 billion during the same quarter of 2024. Local rivals, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, gained market share, while demand for iPhones softened.

Then came Apple's AI problem. While **Microsoft Corp.** MSFT, **Alphabet Inc.** GOOGL, and **Nvidia Corp.** NVDA captured market buzz with new AI-driven features and products, Apple offered few details.

With no firm AI roadmap and delays around the iPhone 17 and the Vision Pro international rollout, many investors began rotating out of Apple into higher-growth tech names like **Nvidia**, **Palantir Technologies Inc**. PLTR **Meta Platforms Inc**. META and **Broadcom Inc.** AVGO

### Can Apple Turn Things Around In July?

On the surface, Apple seems out of favor. But dig into the seasonality, and July could offer the kind of bullish argument that flips the narrative.

Apple's seasonal gains in July are unmatched. Over the past 20 years, the stock has ended July higher 17 times, with an average return of 7.6%.

Even more impressive, Apple is riding a 9-year winning streak in July. The best performances came in 2022 (+18.9%) and 2006 (+18.6%).

Expand the scope to 30 years, and the signal remains intact: Apple averaged a 7.3% gain in July, with a 77% win rate (23 positive closes out of 30).

The biggest drawdowns occurred in 2001 (-19.2%), 2002 (-13.9%), and 2008 (-5.1%)—but those were years defined by broader market crises.

More recently, pullbacks have been minor, like -3.3% in 2015 or -0.6% in 2004.

Apple's relative performance versus the S&P 500 in July has been positive in 77% of the past 30 years, with an average outperformance of 5.8%.

No other S&P 500 stock has matched that consistency or magnitude over the same period.

In short, Apple hasn't just risen in July—it's crushed the market in July, time and time again. And with sentiment scraping cycle lows in 2025, history suggests July has often been Apple's golden window for a rebound.

Text: In This Article: Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 2.6% in the morning session after Jefferies upgraded the stock following a report indicating strong iPhone sales. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee upgraded Apple to 'Hold' from 'Underperform' and raised the price target, citing data from research firm Counterpoint. The data revealed that iPhone sales volume surged 15% year-over-year in the first two months of the June quarter, the most robust growth since the third quarter of 2021. Lee anticipates that this momentum, partly driven by market share recovery in China and tariff-related pull-in demand, could lead to an 8% rise in revenue and a 10% increase in earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $210.29, up 1.2% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Apple’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. Apple is down 13.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $210.29 per share, it is trading 18.8% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,310. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Text: Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day: 1. Butting heads President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated visit to the Federal Reserve on Thursday included an attention-grabbing back-and-forth with Chairman Jerome Powell. It was a sight to behold: Trump and Powell wore white hard hats as they toured an area of the central bank under construction — a project that has been a talking point of the president’s as he’s criticized Powell. As Trump told reporters that renovations of two buildings were costing around $3.1 billion, Powell began shaking his head. Powell said he had not heard that from anyone at the Fed and, after being handed a sheet of paper, explained that the figure included another building’s work from years prior. On a friendlier note, Trump insinuated he was leaving behind the idea of firing Powell, a possibility that’s concerned investors in recent months. CNBC’s Kevin Breuninger laid out the entire scene, which marked the first official visit of a president to the Fed in nearly two decades. 2. More all-time highs Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the opening bell on July 18, 2025, in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty Images It’s been a nice week for investors in S&amp;P 500 -based funds like the VOO or SPY. The broad index has notched new all-time closing highs every day so far this week, bringing its total tally for record closes in 2025 to 13. Meanwhile, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has recorded three all-time-high closes this week alone. All three of the major U.S. stock market indexes are on track to end the week higher. Follow live market updates here. 3. Spending intel Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan speaks at the company’s Annual Manufacturing Technology Conference in San Jose, California, U.S. April 29, 2025. Laure Andrillon | Reuters Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced several spending cuts in a Thursday memo, particularly focused on a division called foundry that produces chips for other companies. Tan put it rather plainly, saying that there would be “no more blank checks” and that investments “must make economic sense.” As CNBC’s Kif Leswing explained, this arm of the business has an operating loss and is in need of a large, centerfold customer. The belt-tightening already appears to be in motion, per Tan: Intel has axed planned fab projects and is consolidating some operations abroad, as well as slowing the construction timeline for a chip factory in Ohio. 4. Clock’s ticking Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce speaks during the Pennsylvania Energy And Innovation Summit 2025 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh on July 15, 2025. David A. Grogan | CNBC After kicking the can down the road for ByteDance to divest from the U.S. business of social media app TikTok, the White House is trying to — literally — lay down the law. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday that it will be lights out for the short-form video platform beloved by Gen Z if it cannot find American owners by the Sept. 17 deadline. Users got a taste of this scenario in January, when Apple and Google removed the platform from their app stores as a prior deadline loomed. On the old economy side of things, Lutnick told CNBC that the major U.S. automakers are “cool with” the trade agreement forged with Japan. 5. Nobody but Sydney Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney star in Sony’s “Anyone But You.” Sony If you clicked on CNBC’s homepage on Thursday, you likely saw a prominently displayed story about actress Sydney Sweeney’s campaign for American Eagle Outfitters driving meme stock traders to the name. It’s one of those cases where the truth is more interesting than fiction. The “Anyone But You” star’s denim-focused advertisement announcement helped drum up interest on the popular Wall Street Bets Reddit page, sending the stock soaring overnight and into Thursday’s session. With that action, the clothing retailer earned a place in the new cohort of meme stocks — including GoPro, Krispy Kreme and Kohl’s — that have seen wild trading this week. — CNBC’s Kevin Breuninger, Sean Conlon, Kif Leswing and Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

Text: A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell on May 6, 2025.

Timothy A. Clary \| Afp \| Getty Images

The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) moved higher on Monday as optimism around earnings overshadowed any investor fears over the latest developments in trade.

The broad market index rose 0.14% and closed at 6,305.60 — marking the first time it ended a session above the 6,300 threshold. The [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) jumped 0.38% for a closing record of 20,974.17. Both indexes hit new all-time intraday highs earlier in the session, bolstered by advances in major technology names like [Meta Platforms](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/). The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) slipped 19.12 points, or 0.04%, and settled at 44,323.07.

This comes as earnings season is off to a strong start. [Verizon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/VZ/) shares popped 4% following a [second-quarter earnings beat](http://www.cnbc.com/www.cnbc.com#108174412-y2mmJ5zt6), spurring excitement that other reports will come in strong. It joins 62 S&P 500 companies that have reported thus far. Of those, more than 85% have topped expectations, according to FactSet data. Earnings for the second quarter are also tracking [5% year-over-year growth](http://www.cnbc.com/www.cnbc.com#108174644-B5mphmjtz) following the first week of results, per Bank of America.

[Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) was a standout in the session, increasing more than 2% ahead of its quarterly results Wednesday after the bell. That name as well as [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) — the first of the "Magnificent Seven" companies set to report — could boost the major averages if they manage to beat estimates. Shares of the electric vehicle maker ended the session marginally lower.

The megacaps are expected to be a major driver of earnings growth during the second-quarter earnings season, and FactSet's John Butters expects the "Magnificent Seven" to post earnings growth of 14% in the second quarter compared to the other 493 S&P 500 companies that are seen posting growth of just 3.4%.

Confidence toward this earnings season was in focus among investors, even as the White House reiterated its position on tariffs over the weekend. On Sunday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick [called Aug. 1 the "hard deadline"](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/20/trump-trade-lutnick-august-1-tariffs.html) for countries to start paying tariffs, though he also added that "nothing stops countries from talking to us after Aug. 1."

"Rarely do you injure yourself falling out of a basement window. With expectations so low in earnings, I think that the end result will end up being better than anticipated," Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNBC. "That is encouraging for the market as well."

More broadly, Stovall pointed out that the market is doing "what it normally does," revealing that it tends to advance on average about another 10% after recovering all of its losses from a decline of up to 20%. With that, he thinks the S&P 500 could reach 6,600 before slipping into a new decline, which implies upside of about 4.7% from Monday's closing level.

"A lot of the negativity has typically been shaken out of the market during these corrections, and now we're seeing articles about maybe the economy is not as bad as we thought it was, consumer confidence is on the mend and we're not seeing the inflation numbers be adversely affected by tariffs," Stovall continued. "Maybe it's just a matter of time before those things kick in, but at least for now, I think investors are saying, 'You know what, the market is indicating that it wants to go higher.'"

## S&P 500, Nasdaq hit record closing highs

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite finished Monday's session with fresh closing records after both indexes scored new all-time intraday highs.

The broad market S&P 500 gained 0.14% to close at 6,305.60, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 0.38% to end at 20,974.17. In contrast, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 19.12 points, or 0.04%, to finish at 44,323.07.

## Wells Fargo's Mayo calls Citi his top pick

Citi is seen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 3, 2025.

NYSE

Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo listed [Citigroup](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C/) as his "dominant," No. 1 pick.

"After listening again to Citi's 2Q25 earnings call, we have more confidence that Citi meets the criteria of many generalist PMs of a company not only w/ line-of-sight restructuring benefits but also favorable revenue growth," Mayo wrote in a Sunday note to clients.

Citi shares rose marginally in Monday morning trading and hit a fresh 52-week high. Mayo's $115 price target implies about 23% upside over where the stock finished last week.

## 'Small surprises could trigger sharp reactions,' strategist says

The stock market may be unusually calm, with the [CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.VIX/) remaining notably muted all month in spite of ongoing risks around trade and inflation, one strategist said. However, that could change quickly in the coming weeks.

"With next week bringing the FOMC meeting, GDP data, a key tariff deadline, and a wave of earnings — in a historically weak window for the markets — even small surprises could trigger sharp reactions," wrote Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. "We're in a window where calm can quickly turn to complacency."

"While a break in either direction is possible, current positioning suggests we'd bet on a rally before a drop," Hackett wrote.

## Nvidia and Tesla are market laggards

Shir Torem \| Reuters

Retail-investor favorites [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) underperformed as the market rose to all-time highs on Monday.

The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) and [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) touched fresh record levels in the session, lifted by gains of more than 1% in tech stocks such as [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/), [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/) and [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/).

But Nvidia and Tesla lagged in afternoon trading, with Nvidia gaining 0.1% and Tesla falling 0.1%. They had both slid about 0.3% earlier in the trading day.

Both stocks have been among the most-bough names from retail traders on balance in recent years, according to [data](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/25/nvidia-sees-remarkable-influx-of-retail-investor-dollars-as-traders-flock-to-ai-darling.html) from Vanda Research.

## BofA: Second-quarter EPS results now tracking for 5% year-over-year growth

Second-quarter earnings season so far is impressing Wall Street.

Financial results from 59 companies in the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) — or 20% of the index — are now in, and are beating consensus estimates by 8% in aggregate, according to Bank of America. Consensus earnings per share results have been revised up 0.5% since July 1 and are now tracking for 5% year-over-year growth, up from 4% last week, the firm said.

Results have shown a "strong breath of beats," Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head of US equity and quantitative strategy, wrote in a Monday note to clients.

After last week's bank earnings, Subramanian commented that "big banks posted solid results with all beating on EPS, but it wasn't enough to lift stocks higher following an already strong rally into earnings."

## Wells Fargo highlights Amazon, Google and Expedia as three top tactical long ideas

In a Sunday note to clients, Wells Fargo highlighted [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/), [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOG/) and [Expedia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EXPE/) as its top tactical long ideas heading into earnings.

"Expect alleviation of supply constraints late in 2Q to enable acceleration commentary to rebut mkt skepticism on AWS \[Amazon Web Services\] 2H growth after weaker 3p data on April & May," wrote analyst Ken Gawrelski.

On the other hand, Google will likely be boosted by an acceleration in search revenues and paid clicks. Accelerating web traffic, positive revisions and an improving U.S. travel backdrop should bolster shares of travel tech company Expedia.

## Sarepta Therapeutics shares continue to slide after several Wall Street firms downgrade the stock

[Sarepta Therapeutics](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SRPT/) were recently down 7% as Wall Street sours on the stock. Needham analyst Ethan Markowski said he's "Throwing in the towel," and Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said, "All Credibility Lost" as they both downgraded shares of in recent days. Mizuho also took its rating to neutral, citing "mounting concerns about Sarepta's businesses."

The possibility is growing that Elevidys, its treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, will be removed from the market, analysts say. Two patients have died after receiving it.

Sarepta shares over the past year.

Also worrisome is that the company didn't disclose the death of a third patient, who was being treated with SRP-9004, an experimental gene therapy for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The trial is now halted.

"We strongly disagree with management regarding their opinion on the materiality of the third death for their gene therapy platform, and again we think this significantly undermines their credibility," said Schwartz, who now rates the stock market perform, with a $10 price target.

On Friday, shares cratered more than 36% after Reuters reported that the Food and Drug Administration has requested that the company stop shipments of the drug, but Sarepta said it will continue to treat ambulatory patients.

Tesla earnings will likely face challenges due to President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointing deliveries, according to Bank of America.

"Although Tesla produces all its vehicles in the US and it manufactures vehicle with a high proportion of content made in North America, the exposure to tariff is not insignificant," analyst Federico Merendi told clients in a Monday note. The electric vehicle maker relies on batteries made in China, Merendi said.

Tesla reports second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday.

Barclays is moving to the sidelines on [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/) stock.

## Barclays upgrades Dollar Tree

A shift in consumer spending behavior could be a boon for [Dollar Tree](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DLTR/) stock, according to Barclays.

The firm upgraded Dollar Tree stock to overweight from equal weight on Monday, and raised its price target $120 per share from $95. Barclays' forecast implies about 9% upside from Friday's $110.12 close.

"Following the FDO \[Family Dollar\] sale, we believe DLTR offers a cleaner growth story with strong momentum observed in Q1, accelerating in Q2 and set up well through the remainder of FY25/26. We see upside to earnings and valuation," analyst Seth Sigman said.

Dollar Tree stock in 2025.

"External drivers are supportive including 'trade in' which could accelerate further this year, and benefits from competitor closings," the analyst added. "Internal initiatives are progressing, including multi price point (both conversions and the core store base) which seems to be resonating while also effectively raising prices on the base assortment with minimal volume impact to date."

## Aug. 1 is ‘hard deadline’ for tariffs, Commerce Secretary Lutnick says

Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce speaks during the Pennsylvania Energy And Innovation Summit 2025 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh on July 15, 2025.

David A. Grogan \| CNBC

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that [Aug. 1 is the deadline](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/20/trump-trade-lutnick-august-1-tariffs.html) for countries to begin paying tariffs to the United States, but said that "nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1."

"That's a hard deadline, so on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in," Lutnick said on CBS News, when asked about the deadline for his tariffs on the European Union.

President Donald Trump's tariff deadline has shifted since he announced his steep levies on trading partners on April 2, but White House officials now maintain that Aug. 1 is a firm deadline.

"Nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on August 1," Lutnick said.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft CEO makes bold statement on company's future originally appeared on TheStreet. In a candid memo released July 24, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed what he called the issue "weighing heavily" on him: the company’s ongoing layoffs. More than 15,000 Microsoft employees have been let go in 2025 alone, as part of what Nadella described as a necessary but painful restructuring in the age of AI. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰 The company also cut nearly 2,000 additional staff deemed "low performers" earlier this year. "I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations," he wrote. Related: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that ChatGPT is not the way to superintelligence Recall Nadella wrote a similar note in 2023 — shortly after the company paused raises and announced its first significant layoffs of the post-pandemic era. He faced criticism at the time for placing too much focus on the company's outperformance without acknowledging those difficult moves. Despite the cuts, investors have rewarded Microsoft’s leaner operating model. The company’s stock closed above $500 for the first time on July 9, a symbolic milestone that arguably underscores Wall Street’s growing faith in Microsoft’s AI strategy. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes technology progress isn't linear. Image source: Ben Kriemann/Getty Images In his July memo, Nadella used stark language to describe the current environment, stating: "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." "Progress isn't linear," he added. "It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before." For the past decade, Microsoft  ( MSFT)  has operated under a unifying purpose: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. But Nadella says that vision now needs to evolve. Related: Analysts unveil bold Amazon stock price target before earnings "We must reimagine our mission for a new era," he wrote. "What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools." This shift reflects the company’s broader transformation from a software-centric business to what Nadella calls an "intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve." Microsoft's strategy hinges on positioning itself at the center of the AI value chain. Its Azure cloud platform is rapidly becoming the infrastructure of choice for AI workloads. OpenAI, as well as other major AI labs and enterprises, use Microsoft's GPU-centric cloud services to train and deploy large models.

Text: **The global technology landscape** is undergoing significant shifts, propelled by fast-moving innovations in technologies. These are exponentially increasing demand for computing power, capturing the attention of management teams and the public, and accelerating experimentation. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of rising global competition as countries and corporations race to secure leadership in producing and applying these strategic technologies.

This year’s McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook provides in-depth perspectives on 13—a “baker’s dozen”—frontier technology trends with the potential to transform global business. Executives today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world where the lines between digital and physical and centralized and decentralized continue to blur. The insights in this report can help business leaders decide which of these frontier technologies are most relevant to their companies by demonstrating how others are starting to apply them today. These findings emerge from our analysis of quantitative measures of interest, innovation, equity investment, and talent that underpin each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions around them. (For more about our research, please see the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)

This outlook highlights transformative trends that are driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, as AI both accelerates progress within individual domains and unlocks new possibilities at the intersections—accelerating the training of robots, advancing scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines aspects of trends we previously analyzed separately as applied AI and generative AI, so this year, they are examined together.

Even as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI’s full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike.

## New and notable

In addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year’s report is [agentic AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage), which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating “virtual coworkers” that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year’s trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities.

AI is also the primary catalyst for another trend we highlight this year: application-specific semiconductors. While [Moore’s Law](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-innovation-revolution-powered-by-ai) and the semiconductor layer of the technology stack have long been key enablers of other tech trends, innovations in semiconductors have spiked as reflected in quantitative metrics such as number of patents. These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption. This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems.

Technology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function—and thus lots of innovation and interest—and it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical. Other trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches—from watchful waiting to aggressive deployment—to business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions.

From the rise of robotics and autonomous systems to the imperative for responsible AI innovations, this year’s technology developments underscore a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and integral to solving global problems. This is illuminated by themes that cut across trends this year:

- _The rise of autonomous systems._ Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. These systems aren’t just executing tasks; they’re starting to learn, adapt, and collaborate. Autonomy is moving toward broad deployment, whether through coordinating last-mile logistics, navigating dynamic environments, or acting as virtual coworkers, among other skills.
- _New human–machine collaboration models._ Human–machine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. From immersive training environments and haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and sensor-enabled wearables, technology is becoming more responsive to human intent and behavior. This evolution is shifting the narrative [from human replacement to augmentation](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/keeping-artificial-intelligence-real)—enabling more natural, productive collaboration between people and intelligent systems. As machines get better at interpreting context, the boundary between operator and cocreator continues to dissolve.
- _Scaling challenges._ The surging demand for compute-intensive workloads, especially from gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments, is creating new demands on global infrastructure. Data center power constraints, physical network vulnerabilities, and rising compute demands have exposed cracks in global infrastructure. But the challenge isn’t just technical: Supply chain delays, labor shortages, and regulatory friction around grid access and permitting are slowing deployments. As a result, scaling now means solving not only for technical architecture and efficient design but also for the messy, real-world challenges in talent, policy, and execution.
- _Regional and national competition._ Global competition over critical technologies has intensified. Countries and corporations have doubled down on sovereign infrastructure, localized chip fabrication, and funding technology initiatives such as quantum labs. This push for self-sufficiency isn’t just about security; it’s about reducing exposure to geopolitical risk and owning the next wave of value creation. The result is a new era of tech-driven competition where nations have a stake in critical industries.
- _Scale and specialization are growing simultaneously._ Growth on these vectors is enabled by innovation in cloud services and advanced connectivity. On one hand, we see rapid growth in general-purpose model training infrastructure in vast, power-hungry data centers, while on the other, we observe accelerating innovation “at the edge,” with lower-power technology embedded in phones, cars, home controls, and industrial devices. This is creating ecosystems that deliver massive large language models with staggering parameter counts, as well as a growing range of domain-specific AI tools that can run almost anywhere. Leaders will balance centralized scale with localized control: Think modular microgrids for clean energy or bespoke robotics for niche manufacturing.
- _Responsible innovation imperatives._ As technologies become more powerful and more personal, trust is increasingly the gatekeeper to adoption. Companies face growing pressure to demonstrate transparency, fairness, and accountability, whether in AI models, gene editing pipelines, or immersive platforms. Ethics are no longer just the right thing to do but rather strategic levers in deployment that can accelerate—or stall—scaling, investment, and long-term impact.

The following illustrations show how different frontier technologies can work together to provide innovative solutions in the future:

After a year in which the macroeconomic environment and broader market weakness provoked significant declines in equity financing for technology across several of our trends, the investment climate for frontier technologies stabilized and, in many cases, rebounded in 2024. Levels of equity investment in trends such as cloud and edge computing, bioengineering, and space technologies increased despite the broader market dip in 2023, while investments in other trends, such as AI and robotics, dipped only to recover to higher levels in 2024 than they achieved two years prior. The two trends with the highest levels of equity investment, the future of energy and sustainability technologies and the future of mobility, declined overall in 2023, but the former bounced back in 2024 (exhibit).

Our baker’s dozen of technology trends shaping 2025 underscores the vast potential of emerging technologies and the need for strategic alignment in an AI-powered future. For executives, success will hinge on identifying high-impact domains in which they can apply these trends, investing in the necessary talent and infrastructure, and addressing external factors like regulatory shifts and ecosystem readiness. By fostering collaboration, bridging ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term vision, leaders can accelerate adoption and position their organizations to drive the next wave of technological transformation. Those who act with focus and agility will not only unlock new value but also shape the future of their industries and the future of today’s emerging frontier technologies.

Text: ## TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services on Sunday said that it will reduce its workforce by 2%, adding that the transition is being planned with due care.

Tata Consultancy Services on Sunday said that it will reduce its workforce by 2% or around 12,000 jobs from its global workforce. **(Bloomberg)**

TCS layoffs: India’s largest software services provider Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will reduce its workforce by 2% or roughly over 12,000 employees in its 2026 financial year.

The company is retraining and redeploying staff in a bid to become more agile and future ready amid rapid disruptions in technology, particularly around Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Mid to senior ranks in focus

The company’s decision is primarily targeted at the middle and senior management, reported _Reuters_.

This decision will impact employees from different countries and domains where TCS operates.

TCS has an employee headcount of 6,13,000 for the latest quarter ended June.

TCS assured that this transition is being planned with “due care” to ensure no disruption in delivering service to the clients.

In the April-June quarter, TCS's operating margins narrowed 20 basis points to 24.5%, amid the company's plans to boost them to 26-28% levels.

Just two weeks ago, TCS also said that their ‘priority’ focus is delivering wage hikes for its over 6 lakh workforce.

“My priority is getting back to the wage hike,” said Chief Financial Officer (CFO) [Samir Seksaria](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-salary-hike-it-major-says-wage-hikes-to-6-lakh-employees-a-priority-heres-what-cfo-says-11752415737293.html) without specifying a deadline for the salary hike for its employees.

## The company’s attrition rate

[TCS employee attrition](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-salary-hike-it-major-says-wage-hikes-to-6-lakh-employees-a-priority-heres-what-cfo-says-11752415737293.html) rate climbed 13.8% on a last twelve-month (LTM) basis as of the end of the April to June quarter of FY2025-26. This marked a marginal rise on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, compared to its 13.3% levels in the January-March quarter of FY 2024-25.

The company's CFO said that with the attrition rate hitting a ‘concerning level’ as of the April-June quarter, the company will now focus on retaining top-level talent, which is difficult to build through fresh hiring.

He also hinted that as the company has capacity now, it may go slow on lateral hirings and restart once the demand surges, according to the agency report.

Synopsis

## The U.S. West Coast has always been the main destination for ambitious software engineers looking to work in the best-paid, most elite corner of their profession, but the mass redundancies have created a pool of jobseekers that Germany is eager to tap.

The U.S. West Coast has always been the main destination for ambitious software engineers looking to work in the best-paid, most elite corner of their profession, but the mass redundancies have created a pool of jobseekers that [Germany](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/germany) is eager to tap.

"They fire, we hire," said Rainer Zugehoer, Chief People Officer at Cariad, the software subsidiary of automaker Volkswagen. "We have several hundred open positions in the U.S., in Europe and in China."

Spooked by inflation and the prospect of recession, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook owner Meta have announced a combined almost 40,000 [job cuts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/job-cuts).

Germany to make it easier for Indians to move for education, jobs](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/germany-to-make-it-easier-for-indians-to-move-for-education-jobs/articleshow/95992640.cms)

Germany, with one of the world's oldest populations, has gaping holes in its labour force: according to IT industry group Bitkom, 137,000 IT [jobs](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/jobs) are unfilled.

The government is simplifying immigration rules and dangling the prospect of easily-acquired citizenship to tempt skilled would-be immigrants, and regional authorities are pressing ahead.

"I would like to cordially invite you to move to Bavaria," wrote Judith Gerlach, digitalisation minister in Germany's wealthiest region on LinkedIn in a post addressed to the recently laid off.

Especially with the euro at dollar parity, few European companies pay rates that compete with the hundreds of thousands of dollars on offer at California's most successful companies, but some hope cheaper healthcare and lower costs compared to hotspots like San Francisco can help.

"And did I mention Oktoberfest?" Gerlach added, adding Munich's famed beer festival to the strong labour protections that might prove attractive to the newly jobless.

Some are sceptical, with Bitkom's Bernhard Rohleder noting that Germany is competing not just with other countries for the most talented, but with potential recruits' home countries too.

Germany's penchant for red tape could be another challenge: companies are already reporting months-long delays in securing appointments for their new hires to get work permits.

"Bureaucracy in Germany is utterly crippling for most highly-qualified workers when they first encounter it, especially if they don't speak German," said Diana Stoleru of Berlin startup Lendis.

2025-07-28 13:09:19,709 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The sentiment analysis for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided summaries is as follows:

1. **Citi Analyst's "Buy" Rating and iPhone Sales Forecast**: The reiteration of a "Buy" rating with a price target of $240 and an adjusted iPhone sales forecast indicates a positive outlook. The June quarter's positive outlook due to tariff pauses and discounts in China is mildly positive, but caution about full-year demand tempers enthusiasm. **Sentiment Score: +2**

2. **Morgan Stanley's "Overweight" Rating**: The reiteration of an "Overweight" rating and anticipation of a robust quarter due to strong sales and favorable conditions is positive. However, the need for clarity on tariffs and AI strategy introduces caution. **Sentiment Score: +2**

3. **JPMorgan's Increased Price Target**: The increase in price target from $230 to $250 due to strong AI performance and services growth is positive. However, competition in AI and the hiring of former Apple executives by Meta highlight competitive pressures. **Sentiment Score: +3**

4. **Securities Fraud Lawsuit**: The lawsuit alleging misrepresentation of AI features and the resulting stock price decline is negative, impacting investor trust and market position. **Sentiment Score: -3**

5. **AI Development Lag**: The perception of lagging in AI development compared to competitors is negative, potentially impacting competitive edge. **Sentiment Score: -2**

6. **Hedge Fund Stake Reduction**: The reduction in holdings by major hedge funds due to concerns about innovation and AI integration is negative, reflecting diminished confidence. **Sentiment Score: -3**

7. **Legal Challenges and Mixed Analyst Ratings**: Ongoing legal challenges and mixed ratings amid AI strategy concerns are negative, though Apple's strong market position offers some balance. **Sentiment Score: -2**

8. **Stock Performance and Market Capitalization**: The stock's recent increase and strong profitability metrics are mildly positive, though the year-to-date decline indicates challenges. **Sentiment Score: +1**

9. **Earnings Report Anticipation**: The anticipation of the earnings report and potential stock movements is neutral, as it reflects standard market dynamics. **Sentiment Score: 0**

10. **Rare Earth Magnets Deal**: The $500 million deal with MP Materials to boost the domestic supply chain is positive, enhancing strategic positioning and reducing reliance on China. **Sentiment Score: +3**

11. **Year-to-Date Stock Decline**: The significant stock decline and underperformance due to AI development lag and trade tensions are negative, though historical trends suggest potential recovery. **Sentiment Score: -3**

12. **Jefferies Upgrade and iPhone Sales Growth**: The upgrade from 'Underperform' to 'Hold' and strong iPhone sales growth are positive, though the stock remains down year-to-date. **Sentiment Score: +2**

Overall, the sentiment for Apple Inc. is mixed, with positive developments in strategic partnerships and analyst ratings countered by challenges in AI development, legal issues, and stock performance. The cumulative sentiment leans slightly negative due to significant concerns about AI competitiveness and legal challenges.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft Corporation logo on sign-by Jean-Luc Ichard via iStock Microsoft (MSFT) is pulling ahead of the competition. Its stock is up 47% from its 52-week low, securing its spot among the best-performing stocks this year. Much of this rise comes from Microsoft’s open embrace of artificial intelligence, with a 33% increase in Azure and other cloud services revenue last quarter, along with a planned $80 billion investment in 2025 to grow its AI and data center footprint. With Microsoft’s next earnings report slated for July 30, can Microsoft’s relentless AI and cloud innovation continue to propel its stock higher, or is the rally due for a reality check? Let’s dig deeper. Opendoor Stock Is Surging Higher in a Frenzied Retail Rally. How Should You Play OPEN Shares Here? Nvidia Stock Warning: This NVDA Challenger Just Scored a Major Customer Analysts Are Cutting Their Price Targets for UnitedHealth Stock Before Q2 Earnings. Is It Time to Ditch Shares? Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. Microsoft (MSFT) has built its business on a mix of software, cloud services, and AI tools, bringing in steady revenue from products like Azure, Office 365, and a wide range of solutions that keep businesses coming back. This solid business mix has helped push Microsoft’s stock up 14.2% over the past 52 weeks and 20% so far this year. www.barchart.com This steady rise has also led to Microsoft trading at a premium, with a market cap around $3.79 trillion. Its forward price-earnings ratio is 34.2x, much higher than the tech sector average of 24.39x, which shows that investors expect even more growth ahead. The latest quarter shows how Microsoft’s business keeps delivering. Revenue reached $70.1 billion, up 13% from last year, thanks to strong results in its main business areas. Operating income climbed 16% to $32 billion, net income was $25.8 billion, up 18%, and diluted earnings per share grew to $3.46. Microsoft’s momentum is being driven by smart moves in AI and cybersecurity. One standout is the integration of Cohesity Gaia with Microsoft 365 Copilot. It’s the first of its kind, allowing employees to access and analyze backup data using generative AI right inside the Copilot workspace. This setup helps teams pull valuable insights from large amounts of data without leaving the Microsoft environment. The system uses role-based access controls to protect sensitive information, adding another layer of security while boosting productivity and the usefulness of Microsoft’s existing tools.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft CEO makes bold statement on company's future originally appeared on TheStreet. In a candid memo released July 24, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed what he called the issue "weighing heavily" on him: the company’s ongoing layoffs. More than 15,000 Microsoft employees have been let go in 2025 alone, as part of what Nadella described as a necessary but painful restructuring in the age of AI. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰 The company also cut nearly 2,000 additional staff deemed "low performers" earlier this year. "I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations," he wrote. Related: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that ChatGPT is not the way to superintelligence Recall Nadella wrote a similar note in 2023 — shortly after the company paused raises and announced its first significant layoffs of the post-pandemic era. He faced criticism at the time for placing too much focus on the company's outperformance without acknowledging those difficult moves. Despite the cuts, investors have rewarded Microsoft’s leaner operating model. The company’s stock closed above $500 for the first time on July 9, a symbolic milestone that arguably underscores Wall Street’s growing faith in Microsoft’s AI strategy. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes technology progress isn't linear. Image source: Ben Kriemann/Getty Images In his July memo, Nadella used stark language to describe the current environment, stating: "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." "Progress isn't linear," he added. "It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before." For the past decade, Microsoft  ( MSFT)  has operated under a unifying purpose: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. But Nadella says that vision now needs to evolve. Related: Analysts unveil bold Amazon stock price target before earnings "We must reimagine our mission for a new era," he wrote. "What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools." This shift reflects the company’s broader transformation from a software-centric business to what Nadella calls an "intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve." Microsoft's strategy hinges on positioning itself at the center of the AI value chain. Its Azure cloud platform is rapidly becoming the infrastructure of choice for AI workloads. OpenAI, as well as other major AI labs and enterprises, use Microsoft's GPU-centric cloud services to train and deploy large models.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the 10 Buzzing Stocks Everyone is Talking About. Brian Schwartz, Oppenheimer analyst, recently talked about Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) during a program on CNBC and explained his bullish case for the company. The analyst has a $600 price target for the stock, which shows a 17% upside potential from July 21 stock price. “What’s going to get Microsoft stock specifically to our price target is going to be upside potential that we think is going to exist from the earnings and their cash flow. As the spending ramps in the near term, we think that the earnings power could be 15% higher than what investors are currently thinking over the next 12 months from Microsoft. That combined with if they can maintain an accelerated growth within the core business, that too could drive a higher multiple for Microsoft.” Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash Mar Vista U.S. Quality Premier Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its  second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation  (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rebounded in calendar Q2 following a strong fiscal Q3 2025 (March quarter), driven by accelerating demand for AI-related Azure services. Robust second-half momentum, coupled with strong bookings as reflected in the Remaining Performance Obligation exceeding $300 billion (+33% year over year), helped ease investor concerns around enterprise IT spending and the long-term return potential of Microsoft’s substantial AI infrastructure investments. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

 Key Points Microsoft has robust fundamentals and significant lucrative growth avenues. The company's dividend growth program looks about as safe as they come. Despite some headwinds it might face, Microsoft's prospects look excellent. 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft › Dividend investors seeking attractive income stocks to buy may be inclined to start with sectors such as utilities, healthcare, or real estate investment trusts (REITs), while reserving the technology industry for those with a growth-oriented focus. However, tech stocks can also be great dividend-paying companies. Take Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): though the company's brand may not evoke the word "dividend" in the minds of most investors, Microsoft is a terrific income stock nonetheless. Read on to find out why. 
 Microsoft's rock-solid underlying business A longtime leader in the technology industry, Microsoft achieved superior returns over the long term -- and a market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion -- thanks to its innovative capabilities and consistent financial results. The company's leadership across several industries, from computer operating systems to cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), helped spur strong growth in recent periods. In the third quarter of its fiscal year 2025, ending on March 31, Microsoft's revenue of $70.1 billion and net income of $25.8 billion grew by 13% and 18% year over year, respectively. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » Microsoft's cloud-computing unit, Azure, was once again one of the top performers. Azure's revenue soared by 33% compared to the year-ago period. Image source: Getty Images. 
 Microsoft has been gaining ground on its longtime competitor in the cloud-computing industry, Amazon. The two should continue to battle it out for a long time, since there is still substantial whitespace in cloud and AI. Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, recently said: "Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth." 
 That should translate into rising demand over the long run, especially since it's arguably still in the early innings of both industries, as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has said. Microsoft's competitive edge, which it derives from its strong brand name and switching costs, should also play a role in helping the company perform well over the long run. However, its most important asset might be its internal culture of innovation. Microsoft has capitalized on significant technological advancements over the past few decades and benefited from them. AI and cloud computing are just the latest. In 10 years, there might be some other new tech trend sweeping through Wall Street. There's no guarantee Microsoft will always lead whatever new market arises, but the company's innovative abilities and substantial pile of cash -- it generated $69.4 billion in free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period -- should enable it to find enough successful growth avenues to continue generating consistent revenue and earnings over the long run. Microsoft's fundamentals are rock solid. The company holds the highest credit rating possible, surpassing even that of the U.S. government. For all these reasons, Microsoft appears to be a safe, long-term investment even before considering the dividend. Plenty of room for dividend hikes Income-seeking investors will appreciate Microsoft's strong operations. Consistent payouts mean little unless the company backing them can sustain them and perhaps even afford regular dividend increases. Microsoft can do that, and it has done so in recent years. Over the past decade, the company's dividend has increased by 167.7%. Yet, there is plenty more room for the company to grow it as evidenced by its modest 29.4% cash payout ratio. Some might even argue that Microsoft's payout ratio is too conservative. Perhaps the company could afford more aggressive dividend hikes without significantly impacting the cash it plans to reinvest in the business to spur growth. Whether or not that's the case, one thing seems clear: Microsoft has plenty of room to increase its dividends some more. So, investors shouldn't dwell too much on its 0.7% forward yield, which is even lower than the S&amp;P 500 's modest 1.3% average. 
 A strong dividend, multiple growth avenues, and solid operations -- are there any reasons not to buy Microsoft's shares? Some might point to valuation -- the stock trades at 33.4 times forward earnings. That's above the S&amp;P 500's average of 22.3 and the information technology industry's 29.2. However, Microsoft deserves a premium given its leadership in two fast-growing markets. The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio is fair relative to its growth potential. Others might also worry that Microsoft will see business disruptions if economic troubles hit, perhaps as a result of Trump's trade policies. That may be true, but Microsoft should be able to recover from those; it has lasted for decades and survived plenty of downturns before. Microsoft will encounter some challenges, but long-term investors should stay put. The stock can deliver superior returns from here on out just as it has in the past. Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Text: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella talks with Indonesia's Minister of Communication and Information Technology Budi Arie Setiadi, on the day of their meeting with Indonesian President Joko WIdodo, at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia, April 30, 2024. Willy Kurniawan | Reuters Microsoft has laid off over 15,000 people so far in 2025. The stress of the belt-tightening has gotten to CEO Satya Nadella. "Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations," Nadella wrote in a memo to employees Thursday. After Microsoft's latest labor reductions, investors pushed the stock's closing price above $500 for the first time on July 9. The company announced the layoffs of about 9,000 people a week earlier. Microsoft employed 228,000 people as of June 2024. It hasn't provided a new figure that takes into account its layoffs this year, but Nadella wrote that headcount is basically flat. "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value," he wrote. "Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before." The cuts at Microsoft are reflective of an overall trend across the tech industry, with over 80,000 positions eliminated to date in 2025, according to one count. Recruit Holdings announced earlier this month that it would lay off 1,300 people from its human resources technology segment that includes the Indeed and Glassdoor websites. The company's CEO pointed to artificial intelligence in a memo, Bloomberg reported. On social media in recent months, some Microsoft employees have become disheartened about the company's cutbacks, given its stature. "I have loved working for this company, still do, but this has done so much damage to that loyalty because it has shown that Microsoft's espoused values do not apply to business decisions at the macro level," a person who lists themselves as a Microsoft directed on LinkedIn posted last week. Microsoft is the world's most valuable public company after Nvidia, whose chips have become a critical piece of the AI arms race. Microsoft's Windows and Office franchises remain dominant, and its Azure cloud services have seen faster growth in recent years as OpenAI and other companies rent out Nvidia graphics cards to run AI models. In the memo, Nadella touched on Microsoft's mission for the past 10 years, which has been to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, and how the rise of AI is changing it. "We must reimagine our mission for a new era," he wrote. "What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve." Microsoft reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. WATCH: Microsoft poaches more Google DeepMind AI talent as AI talent wars continue

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which is the world’s second-largest company, is scheduled to report its quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday. Ahead of the earnings release, CEO Satya Nadella shared his thoughts on the latest job cuts at the company, as well as his priorities and the culture he aims to foster.

[Microsoft stock](https://stocktwits.com/news-articles/markets/equity/paramount-finally-gets-trump-administration-s-greenlight-for-skydance-merger/choGDn7R5v8) has gained nearly 22% this year, outperforming the broader market and the tech sector. It is also the third-best performer among the Magnificent Seven group, after Nvidia and Meta.

In a blog post published on Thursday as the company started a new fiscal year, Nadella said, “I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations.”

Calling these decisions the “most difficult,” he expressed his gratitude to those who were laid off.

After slashing 10,000 jobs in 2023 when the company had to contend with a demand slowdown amid an inflationary spike, the company has eliminated more personnel this year.

In May, the company laid off 6,000 employees, citing the organizational changes necessary to best position itself for success in a dynamic marketplace. The company cut 305 permanent positions in early June.

The Windows software maker followed up with another round of layoffs in early July, this time eliminating 9,000 employees, marking the second-largest in its history. Employees across teams were impacted, including its sales division and Xbox video game business.

Following the May layoffs, Barclays analysts said they saw the elimination as a “commitment to profitable growth," especially as artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure costs continue to ramp up in the medium term.”

Microsoft has been among the frontrunners in the AI race, having forged an expanded partnership with Sam Altman-led startup OpenAI in early 2023.

While acknowledging the current uncertain times, Nadella said, “By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving — our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right.”

He noted that Redmond was investing more in capital expenditure, maintaining its headcount steady despite the eliminations, and also recognized and rewarded talents and expertise at levels never seen before.

“And yet, at the same time, we’ve undergone layoffs,” Nadella said. “This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.”

The success Microsoft wants to achieve, Nadella said, requires meeting “changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.”

Text: In This Article: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Tracking Closely.  On July 21, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $550 from $494 and kept an “Overweight” rating on the shares. The rating affirmation follows a positive outlook on software earnings as Microsoft heads into second-quarter results. It believes the setup for on-cycle reporting software names is positive. April did have some levels of uncertainty, but May channel checks and those of June have been much stronger, as noted by the analysts. Consequently, the firm anticipates solid Q2 prints and a chance for an increase in guidance. A software engineer with headset typing at a computer terminal, surrounded by multiple monitors. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides AI-powered cloud, productivity, and business solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and AI advancements.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft Corporation logo on sign-by Jean-Luc Ichard via iStock Microsoft (MSFT) is pulling ahead of the competition. Its stock is up 47% from its 52-week low, securing its spot among the best-performing stocks this year. Much of this rise comes from Microsoft’s open embrace of artificial intelligence, with a 33% increase in Azure and other cloud services revenue last quarter, along with a planned $80 billion investment in 2025 to grow its AI and data center footprint. With Microsoft’s next earnings report slated for July 30, can Microsoft’s relentless AI and cloud innovation continue to propel its stock higher, or is the rally due for a reality check? Let’s dig deeper. Opendoor Stock Is Surging Higher in a Frenzied Retail Rally. How Should You Play OPEN Shares Here? Nvidia Stock Warning: This NVDA Challenger Just Scored a Major Customer Analysts Are Cutting Their Price Targets for UnitedHealth Stock Before Q2 Earnings. Is It Time to Ditch Shares? Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. Microsoft (MSFT) has built its business on a mix of software, cloud services, and AI tools, bringing in steady revenue from products like Azure, Office 365, and a wide range of solutions that keep businesses coming back. This solid business mix has helped push Microsoft’s stock up 14.2% over the past 52 weeks and 20% so far this year. www.barchart.com This steady rise has also led to Microsoft trading at a premium, with a market cap around $3.79 trillion. Its forward price-earnings ratio is 34.2x, much higher than the tech sector average of 24.39x, which shows that investors expect even more growth ahead. The latest quarter shows how Microsoft’s business keeps delivering. Revenue reached $70.1 billion, up 13% from last year, thanks to strong results in its main business areas. Operating income climbed 16% to $32 billion, net income was $25.8 billion, up 18%, and diluted earnings per share grew to $3.46. Microsoft’s momentum is being driven by smart moves in AI and cybersecurity. One standout is the integration of Cohesity Gaia with Microsoft 365 Copilot. It’s the first of its kind, allowing employees to access and analyze backup data using generative AI right inside the Copilot workspace. This setup helps teams pull valuable insights from large amounts of data without leaving the Microsoft environment. The system uses role-based access controls to protect sensitive information, adding another layer of security while boosting productivity and the usefulness of Microsoft’s existing tools.

Text: **Microsoft**( [MSFT](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/msft/) -0.74%) has been a steady yet quiet outperformer this year. While the market is up around 6%, Microsoft shares have risen an outstanding 20%. Most of Microsoft's strength is derived from its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

We'll receive more information regarding the AI arms race on July 30 when Microsoft reports its results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2025. These events can bring significant stock price swings.

If you're a firm believer that Microsoft will post guidance-beating results, then picking up shares right now seems like the smart move.

## Microsoft Azure is a huge driving factor for the stock

Microsoft is far more than the company that makes Word or Excel. It's also the owner of LinkedIn, Xbox, and Activision Blizzard, the game creator. It divides its business into three units: productivity and business processes (the products most people think of when they hear Microsoft), more personal computing (Microsoft-branded hardware and its gaming platforms), and intelligent cloud.

Intelligent Cloud is the primary reason investors are bullish on Microsoft's stock, as it drives significant growth for the company. In its fiscal third quarter (ending March 31), productivity and business processes grew revenue 10% and more personal computing increased sales at a 6% pace. Those two growth rates are common for a mature company like Microsoft, but its Intelligent Cloud is anything but old and boring. It grew revenue at a 21% pace, led by Azure's 33% growth.

Azure is Microsoft's [cloud computing division](https://www.fool.com/terms/c/cloud-computing/), which is the primary beneficiary of all of the AI spending that's going on. Microsoft isn't directly competing in the AI arms race with a [generative AI model](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/generative-ai/). Its investment and partnership with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is a key part of Azure's growth, as OpenAI was the first mover in this space and is generally seen as the leader. However, Azure also offers other leading AI models such as Llama from **Meta Platforms**; China-based DeepSeek, a much cheaper generative AI model; and Grok from xAI, Elon Musk's generative AI company.

This library of generative AI models is a key reason why Microsoft is winning on the cloud computing front, as it aims to be an AI facilitator, rather than just promoting a single model.

The future is also bright for Azure, as the global cloud computing market is expected to expand from a $750 billion base in 2024 to $2.4 trillion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. This growth stems from both AI and non-AI workloads, serving as a massive tailwind that pushes Azure higher, alongside Microsoft's stock.

When Microsoft reports on July 30, I'll be watching management's language regarding Azure, as there is no room for weakness in this critical division.

## Microsoft's stock has a premium valuation and looks a tad expensive

With Microsoft's impressive run and leadership position in the industry, it should come as no surprise that the stock has garnered a premium valuation. At more than [33 times forward earnings,](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/forward-pe/) it trades at the top end of its valuation range.

[MSFT PE Ratio (Forward)](https://ycharts.com/companies/MSFT/forward_pe_ratio) data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)

This premium valuation has some merit, as Microsoft has consistently grown its [earnings per share (EPS)](https://www.fool.com/terms/e/earnings-per-share/) at a market-beating pace.

[MSFT EPS Basic (Quarterly YoY Growth)](https://ycharts.com/companies/MSFT/net_eps_basic_growth) data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)

Still, if you look at other companies in Microsoft's valuation range, most are growing their EPS at a much quicker pace.

[AMZN PE Ratio (Forward)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/forward_pe_ratio) data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)

As a result, I think investors should be patient with Microsoft's stock. Microsoft has been and will continue to be an excellent AI stock to own, but there's no denying it has gotten expensive. Investors should wait to see what Microsoft has to say on July 30 before [rushing to buy the stock today.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/10/the-best-stocks-to-invest-50000-in-right-now/)

Text: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at Microsoft Build AI Day in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024. Adek Berry | AFP | Getty Images Microsoft said Wednesday that it will lay off about 9,000 employees. The move will affect less than 4% of its global workforce across different teams, geographies and levels of experience, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The announcement comes on the second day of Microsoft’s 2026 fiscal year. Executives at the Redmond, Washington-based company typically unveil reorganizations at the time of the new fiscal year. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email. Microsoft has held several rounds of layoffs already this calendar year. In January, it cut less than 1% of headcount based on performance. The 50-year-old software company slashed more than 6,000 jobs in May and then at least 300 more in June. As of June 2024 it employed 228,000 people. In 2023, it laid off 10,000. Perhaps the largest culling of Microsoft workers came in 2014, when the company eliminated 18,000 after acquiring Nokia’s devices and services business. As was the case with the May layoffs, Microsoft is looking to reduce the number of layers of managers that stand between individual contributors and top executives, said the person who asked not to be named while discussing internal matters. “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo to employees in that division. Microsoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter. The numbers were well ahead of Wall Street’s consensus, keeping Microsoft ranked as one of the most profitable companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, according to data compiled by FactSet. Executives called for about 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, thanks to expected expansion in Azure cloud services and corporate productivity software subscriptions. Microsoft stock closed at a record high of $497.45 per share on June 26. It closed down 0.2% on Wednesday, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%. Autodesk, Chegg and CrowdStrike are among the other software providers that have slimmed down in 2025. Earlier on Wednesday, payroll processing company ADP said the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June. Economists polled by Dow Jones had predicted an increase of 100,000.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the 10 Buzzing Stocks Everyone is Talking About. Brian Schwartz, Oppenheimer analyst, recently talked about Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) during a program on CNBC and explained his bullish case for the company. The analyst has a $600 price target for the stock, which shows a 17% upside potential from July 21 stock price. “What’s going to get Microsoft stock specifically to our price target is going to be upside potential that we think is going to exist from the earnings and their cash flow. As the spending ramps in the near term, we think that the earnings power could be 15% higher than what investors are currently thinking over the next 12 months from Microsoft. That combined with if they can maintain an accelerated growth within the core business, that too could drive a higher multiple for Microsoft.” Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash Mar Vista U.S. Quality Premier Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its  second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation  (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rebounded in calendar Q2 following a strong fiscal Q3 2025 (March quarter), driven by accelerating demand for AI-related Azure services. Robust second-half momentum, coupled with strong bookings as reflected in the Remaining Performance Obligation exceeding $300 billion (+33% year over year), helped ease investor concerns around enterprise IT spending and the long-term return potential of Microsoft’s substantial AI infrastructure investments. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft CEO makes bold statement on company's future originally appeared on TheStreet. In a candid memo released July 24, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed what he called the issue "weighing heavily" on him: the company’s ongoing layoffs. More than 15,000 Microsoft employees have been let go in 2025 alone, as part of what Nadella described as a necessary but painful restructuring in the age of AI. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰 The company also cut nearly 2,000 additional staff deemed "low performers" earlier this year. "I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations," he wrote. Related: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that ChatGPT is not the way to superintelligence Recall Nadella wrote a similar note in 2023 — shortly after the company paused raises and announced its first significant layoffs of the post-pandemic era. He faced criticism at the time for placing too much focus on the company's outperformance without acknowledging those difficult moves. Despite the cuts, investors have rewarded Microsoft’s leaner operating model. The company’s stock closed above $500 for the first time on July 9, a symbolic milestone that arguably underscores Wall Street’s growing faith in Microsoft’s AI strategy. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes technology progress isn't linear. Image source: Ben Kriemann/Getty Images In his July memo, Nadella used stark language to describe the current environment, stating: "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." "Progress isn't linear," he added. "It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before." For the past decade, Microsoft  ( MSFT)  has operated under a unifying purpose: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. But Nadella says that vision now needs to evolve. Related: Analysts unveil bold Amazon stock price target before earnings "We must reimagine our mission for a new era," he wrote. "What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools." This shift reflects the company’s broader transformation from a software-centric business to what Nadella calls an "intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve." Microsoft's strategy hinges on positioning itself at the center of the AI value chain. Its Azure cloud platform is rapidly becoming the infrastructure of choice for AI workloads. OpenAI, as well as other major AI labs and enterprises, use Microsoft's GPU-centric cloud services to train and deploy large models.

Text: Chinese Premier Li Qiang spoke at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Saturday, July 26, 2025.

Bloomberg \| Bloomberg \| Getty Images

SHANGHAI — The tech race between the world’s two largest economies just intensified.

China on Saturday [released a global action plan for artificial intelligence](https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202507/content_7033929.htm), calling for international cooperation on tech development and regulation.

The news came as the annual state-organized World Artificial Intelligence Conference kicked off in Shanghai with an opening speech by Premier Li Qiang, who announced that the Chinese government has proposed the establishment of a global AI cooperation organization, according to an [official readout](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/wjdt_674879/gjldrhd_674881/202507/t20250726_11677829.shtml).

Days earlier, U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) announced an American action plan for AI that included calls to reduce alleged “woke” bias in AI models and support the [deployment of U.S. tech overseas](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/no-woke-ai-in-washington-says-trump-as-he-launches-ai-action-plan.html).

“The two camps are now being formed,” said George Chen, partner at the Asia Group and co-chair of the digital practice.

“China clearly wants to stick to the multilateral approach while the U.S. wants to build its own camp, very much targeting the rise of China in the field of AI,” Chen said.

He noted how China may attract participants from its Belt and Road Initiative, while the U.S. will likely have the support of its allies, such as Japan and Australia.

In his speech, Premier Li emphasized China’s “AI plus” plan for integrating the tech across industries and said the country was willing to help other nations with the technology, especially in the [Global South. The category loosely refers to](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/25/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-whispers-of-a-new-world-order.html) less developed economies, especially countries outside the U.S. and European orbits.

Since 2022, the U.S. has sought to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors for training AI models. Earlier this month, U.S. chipmaker [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) said the U.S. was allowing it to resume shipments of a less advanced [H20 chip to China](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/amd-mi308-ai-chip-china.html) after a roughly three-month pause.

However, China has been developing homegrown alternatives, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang both praised and described as “formidable” this month during his third trip to China this year.

Former [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) CEO Eric Schmidt met with Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Jining on Thursday in the city ahead of the AI conference, according to a [city announcement](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hcUjD19ryDwV0g-fZHHzJQ). A representative for Schmidt declined to comment.

July 24 (Reuters) - Businesses focused on artificial intelligence are raking it in so far this earnings season. Those catering to actual people, less so.

The AI spending surge is providing a big boost for semiconductor and software giants like Google parent Alphabet

[(GOOGL.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O)

, while companies from airlines to restaurants and food manufacturers are struggling to navigate an erratic U.S. trade policy which is boosting costs, upending supply chains and hurting consumer confidence.

Along with Alphabet, SK Hynix and India's Infosys

[(INFY.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/INFY.NS)

exceeded market forecasts on Thursday and predicted brighter days to come, with Alphabet and SK Hynix both flagging plans to boost spending. SK supplies the world's most valuable company Nvidia

[(NVDA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O)

, the AI chipmaking giant that recently [surpassed $4 trillion in market value](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-becomes-first-company-clinch-4-trillion-market-value-2025-07-09/).

By contrast, executives at many consumer names were less enthusiastic, from luxury bellwether LVMH

[(LVMH.PA), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LVMH.PA)

, packaged food giant Nestle

[(NESN.S), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NESN.S)

, to toymakers Hasbro

[(HAS.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/HAS.O)

and Mattel

[(MAT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MAT.O)

and airlines Southwest

[(LUV.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LUV.N)

and American

[(AAL.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAL.O)

.

They, along with automakers and giants like [Coca-Cola](https://www.reuters.com/business/coca-cola-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-steady-soda-demand-2025-07-22/)

[(KO.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/KO.N)

, have indicated that some segments of the buying public have pulled in their spending as prices and interest rates remain high.

The dichotomy is evident in [IBM's results](https://www.reuters.com/business/ibms-software-sales-disappoint-eclipsing-ai-mainframe-revival-2025-07-23/). Sales in Big Blue's "AI book of business" grew 25 percent in its most recent quarter to $7.5 billion, while its software segment fell short of expectations and the company sounded cautious about how much its consulting segment might grow this year.

The equity market has accentuated the positive. News that the U.S. had struck a trade [deal](https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-strikes-tariff-deal-with-japan-auto-stocks-surge-2025-07-23/) with Japan and was closing in on a deal with the European Union ahead of an Aug 1. deadline boosted markets. The broad S&P 500

[(.SPX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.SPX)

notched another record this week and [the Eurostoxx](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/european-shares-close-higher-after-ecb-leaves-rates-unchanged-2025-07-24/)

[(.STOXXE), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.STOXXE)

was just a few points shy of that mark.

"The market is getting friendly with a view that tariffs ending up higher than they have ever been for 100 years will not have a negative impact on economic growth, because we haven't seen any negative impact on economic growth so far," said Van Luu, head of solutions strategy, fixed income and foreign exchange at Russell Investments.

Whether companies continue to absorb that hit remains to be seen. So far, companies have [reported](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-TRUMP/TARIFF-COMPANIES/movadjkmnpa/) over July 16-22 a combined full-year loss of as much as $7.8 billion, with automotive, aerospace and pharmaceutical sectors hurt the most by tariffs, according to a Reuters tariff tracker.

U.S. averages have been buoyed by the so-called [Magnificent Seven](https://www.reuters.com/data/magnificent-seven-monitor-2024-10-30/), a group of tech giants that has benefited heavily from spending plans on artificial intelligence, and currently accounts for more than 30% of the value of the S&P.

"AI is one of the strongest areas of growth for the economy, and the market mirrors the economy," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments.

To be sure, the market's reaction may be in part because a larger-than-normal percentage of companies are clearing a lowered bar for estimates. At the beginning of April, the market expected 10.2% year-over-year S&P earnings growth, but by July, that number had dropped to 5.8%, according to LSEG data. With about 30% of constituents reporting results, the blended earnings growth rate sits at 7.7%.

## TECH GOES FULL SPEED AHEAD

AI-focused businesses continued to print money in the most recent quarter. Nvidia

[(NVDA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O)

supplier SK Hynix [posted record quarterly profit](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nvidia-supplier-sk-hynix-plans-boost-spending-after-record-q2-profit-2025-07-23/), boosted by demand for artificial intelligence chips and customers stockpiling ahead of potential U.S. tariffs.

Indian IT services provider Infosys

[(INFY.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/INFY.NS)

raised the floor of its annual revenue [forecast](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/infosys-raises-annual-revenue-forecast-financial-services-boost-2025-07-23/) range to 1% to 3%, from flat to 3%, matching analyst expectations.

"The tech community is going ahead full speed ahead... and banks are in a very strong position now," said Bill George, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic and executive education fellow at Harvard Business School. "Other companies will struggle to get growth."

## UNCERTAIN CONSUMER

Consumer companies have been less upbeat. Nestle, the world's biggest packaged food maker, [reported softer demand](https://www.reuters.com/business/nestle-announces-vitamins-business-review-after-sluggish-sales-growth-2025-07-24/) as it struggled to win thrifty shoppers to its big brands.

U.S. airlines [Southwest](https://www.reuters.com/business/southwest-airlines-earnings-hit-by-weak-us-travel-demand-2025-07-23/) and [American Airlines](https://www.reuters.com/business/american-airlines-forecasts-wide-range-due-economic-uncertainty-2025-07-24/) warned that Americans are travelling less, the latest signal that U.S. consumers are remaining cautious about their spending. Toymakers Mattel and Hasbro both said uncertainties around tariffs are acting as a headwind.

Carmakers are among firms dealing with the most difficulty. The auto giants are resisting raising prices, eating the cost of tariffs that may cost them millions or billions of dollars. Levies on metals, [copper](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trumps-copper-tariffs-pile-more-metal-misery-us-auto-industry-2025-07-11/) and auto parts made it harder to navigate changing tariff policies.

South Korea's Hyundai Motor

[(005380.KS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/005380.KS)

on Thursday posted a 16% decline in second-quarter operating profit, saying U.S. tariffs cost it 828 billion won ($606.5 million) in the second quarter, with a bigger hit expected in the current quarter. General Motors

[(GM.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GM.N)

still expects a $4 billion to $5 billion hit to its bottom line this year.

On Wednesday, Tesla

Text: **The global technology landscape** is undergoing significant shifts, propelled by fast-moving innovations in technologies. These are exponentially increasing demand for computing power, capturing the attention of management teams and the public, and accelerating experimentation. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of rising global competition as countries and corporations race to secure leadership in producing and applying these strategic technologies.

This year’s McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook provides in-depth perspectives on 13—a “baker’s dozen”—frontier technology trends with the potential to transform global business. Executives today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world where the lines between digital and physical and centralized and decentralized continue to blur. The insights in this report can help business leaders decide which of these frontier technologies are most relevant to their companies by demonstrating how others are starting to apply them today. These findings emerge from our analysis of quantitative measures of interest, innovation, equity investment, and talent that underpin each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions around them. (For more about our research, please see the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)

This outlook highlights transformative trends that are driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, as AI both accelerates progress within individual domains and unlocks new possibilities at the intersections—accelerating the training of robots, advancing scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines aspects of trends we previously analyzed separately as applied AI and generative AI, so this year, they are examined together.

Even as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI’s full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike.

## New and notable

In addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year’s report is [agentic AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage), which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating “virtual coworkers” that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year’s trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities.

AI is also the primary catalyst for another trend we highlight this year: application-specific semiconductors. While [Moore’s Law](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-innovation-revolution-powered-by-ai) and the semiconductor layer of the technology stack have long been key enablers of other tech trends, innovations in semiconductors have spiked as reflected in quantitative metrics such as number of patents. These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption. This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems.

Technology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function—and thus lots of innovation and interest—and it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical. Other trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches—from watchful waiting to aggressive deployment—to business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions.

From the rise of robotics and autonomous systems to the imperative for responsible AI innovations, this year’s technology developments underscore a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and integral to solving global problems. This is illuminated by themes that cut across trends this year:

- _The rise of autonomous systems._ Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. These systems aren’t just executing tasks; they’re starting to learn, adapt, and collaborate. Autonomy is moving toward broad deployment, whether through coordinating last-mile logistics, navigating dynamic environments, or acting as virtual coworkers, among other skills.
- _New human–machine collaboration models._ Human–machine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. From immersive training environments and haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and sensor-enabled wearables, technology is becoming more responsive to human intent and behavior. This evolution is shifting the narrative [from human replacement to augmentation](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/keeping-artificial-intelligence-real)—enabling more natural, productive collaboration between people and intelligent systems. As machines get better at interpreting context, the boundary between operator and cocreator continues to dissolve.
- _Scaling challenges._ The surging demand for compute-intensive workloads, especially from gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments, is creating new demands on global infrastructure. Data center power constraints, physical network vulnerabilities, and rising compute demands have exposed cracks in global infrastructure. But the challenge isn’t just technical: Supply chain delays, labor shortages, and regulatory friction around grid access and permitting are slowing deployments. As a result, scaling now means solving not only for technical architecture and efficient design but also for the messy, real-world challenges in talent, policy, and execution.
- _Regional and national competition._ Global competition over critical technologies has intensified. Countries and corporations have doubled down on sovereign infrastructure, localized chip fabrication, and funding technology initiatives such as quantum labs. This push for self-sufficiency isn’t just about security; it’s about reducing exposure to geopolitical risk and owning the next wave of value creation. The result is a new era of tech-driven competition where nations have a stake in critical industries.
- _Scale and specialization are growing simultaneously._ Growth on these vectors is enabled by innovation in cloud services and advanced connectivity. On one hand, we see rapid growth in general-purpose model training infrastructure in vast, power-hungry data centers, while on the other, we observe accelerating innovation “at the edge,” with lower-power technology embedded in phones, cars, home controls, and industrial devices. This is creating ecosystems that deliver massive large language models with staggering parameter counts, as well as a growing range of domain-specific AI tools that can run almost anywhere. Leaders will balance centralized scale with localized control: Think modular microgrids for clean energy or bespoke robotics for niche manufacturing.
- _Responsible innovation imperatives._ As technologies become more powerful and more personal, trust is increasingly the gatekeeper to adoption. Companies face growing pressure to demonstrate transparency, fairness, and accountability, whether in AI models, gene editing pipelines, or immersive platforms. Ethics are no longer just the right thing to do but rather strategic levers in deployment that can accelerate—or stall—scaling, investment, and long-term impact.

The following illustrations show how different frontier technologies can work together to provide innovative solutions in the future:

After a year in which the macroeconomic environment and broader market weakness provoked significant declines in equity financing for technology across several of our trends, the investment climate for frontier technologies stabilized and, in many cases, rebounded in 2024. Levels of equity investment in trends such as cloud and edge computing, bioengineering, and space technologies increased despite the broader market dip in 2023, while investments in other trends, such as AI and robotics, dipped only to recover to higher levels in 2024 than they achieved two years prior. The two trends with the highest levels of equity investment, the future of energy and sustainability technologies and the future of mobility, declined overall in 2023, but the former bounced back in 2024 (exhibit).

Our baker’s dozen of technology trends shaping 2025 underscores the vast potential of emerging technologies and the need for strategic alignment in an AI-powered future. For executives, success will hinge on identifying high-impact domains in which they can apply these trends, investing in the necessary talent and infrastructure, and addressing external factors like regulatory shifts and ecosystem readiness. By fostering collaboration, bridging ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term vision, leaders can accelerate adoption and position their organizations to drive the next wave of technological transformation. Those who act with focus and agility will not only unlock new value but also shape the future of their industries and the future of today’s emerging frontier technologies.

Text: JPMorgan Chase has overhauled the leadership of its internal research group responsible for quantum computing and other forms of advanced technology, hiring a State Street executive, CNBC has learned. Marco Pistoia, the former IBM inventor who became head of JPMorgan’s applied research group in 2020, has recently left the bank, according to a person briefed on the matter, who declined to be identified speaking about personnel. That group conducted research into how emerging technologies including quantum computing and communications, blockchain, computer vision and networking could solve problems in finance. JPMorgan has hired Rob Otter, who is State Street’s global head of digital technology and quantum computing, to replace Pistoia, according to an employee memo sent Monday. Before joining State Street in 2022, Otter was head of JPMorgan’s Onyx blockchain business and worked in technology roles at Barclays, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. Rob Otter is a former State Street technology executive who is becoming JPMorgan Chase’s new head of the GT Applied Research (GTAR) team. Courtesy: JPMorgan Chase Co. Quantum computing has the potential for huge advances over traditional computing and is expected to have applications in finance, drug development and materials science, among other fields. Tech giants including Alphabet and IBM are racing to create a reliable quantum computer with commercial applications, while small publicly traded quantum companies like Rigetti Computing and D-Wave have seen their shares surge over enthusiasm in the nascent field. One of Pistoia’s deputies, Charles Lim, who was the bank’s global head for quantum communications and cryptography, has also departed, according to the person familiar with the changes. JPMorgan had touted the credentials of Pistoia and Lim while the firm was building out its research group. Pistoia has at least 270 patents, according to a 2023 biography, and had been named a “ Master Inventor ” at IBM, a title given to researchers who regularly produce valuable patents. Pistoia didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment. Lim couldn’t be reached.

Text: ## TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services on Sunday said that it will reduce its workforce by 2%, adding that the transition is being planned with due care.

Tata Consultancy Services on Sunday said that it will reduce its workforce by 2% or around 12,000 jobs from its global workforce. **(Bloomberg)**

TCS layoffs: India’s largest software services provider Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will reduce its workforce by 2% or roughly over 12,000 employees in its 2026 financial year.

The company is retraining and redeploying staff in a bid to become more agile and future ready amid rapid disruptions in technology, particularly around Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Mid to senior ranks in focus

The company’s decision is primarily targeted at the middle and senior management, reported _Reuters_.

This decision will impact employees from different countries and domains where TCS operates.

TCS has an employee headcount of 6,13,000 for the latest quarter ended June.

TCS assured that this transition is being planned with “due care” to ensure no disruption in delivering service to the clients.

In the April-June quarter, TCS's operating margins narrowed 20 basis points to 24.5%, amid the company's plans to boost them to 26-28% levels.

Just two weeks ago, TCS also said that their ‘priority’ focus is delivering wage hikes for its over 6 lakh workforce.

“My priority is getting back to the wage hike,” said Chief Financial Officer (CFO) [Samir Seksaria](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-salary-hike-it-major-says-wage-hikes-to-6-lakh-employees-a-priority-heres-what-cfo-says-11752415737293.html) without specifying a deadline for the salary hike for its employees.

## The company’s attrition rate

[TCS employee attrition](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-salary-hike-it-major-says-wage-hikes-to-6-lakh-employees-a-priority-heres-what-cfo-says-11752415737293.html) rate climbed 13.8% on a last twelve-month (LTM) basis as of the end of the April to June quarter of FY2025-26. This marked a marginal rise on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, compared to its 13.3% levels in the January-March quarter of FY 2024-25.

The company's CFO said that with the attrition rate hitting a ‘concerning level’ as of the April-June quarter, the company will now focus on retaining top-level talent, which is difficult to build through fresh hiring.

He also hinted that as the company has capacity now, it may go slow on lateral hirings and restart once the demand surges, according to the agency report.

Text: ## Microsoft to Lay Off Thousands; Xbox Chief Says Gaming Division Cuts Will Remove ‘Layers of Management’

Getty Images

_**UPDATE:** [Microsoft](https://variety.com/t/microsoft/) is scrapping [two upcoming video games](https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/), a reboot of “Perfect Dark” and the fantasy title “Everwild,” in addition to ending development on several unannounced projects. It is also shutting down “Perfect Dark” studio The Initiative._

Following rumors of reductions that first began last week, Microsoft is set to lay off more than 9,000 employees worldwide Wednesday, including some in the Microsoft Gaming/ [Xbox](https://variety.com/t/xbox/) division. _Variety_ has confirmed the number of staff impacted is under 4% of Microsoft’s global workforce, which totals approximately 228,000 employees.

“We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said Wednesday.

“To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Microsoft Gaming chief Phil Spencer said in a memo to staff Wednesday morning. “Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.”

Additional details regarding the Microsoft layoffs and which divisions have been impacted (sources tell _Variety_ that the cuts in gaming do not make up the majority) are expected to be shared later Wednesday.

See below for Spencer’s full memo to staff, which was sent Wednesday and obtained by _Variety_, announcing the company-wide layoffs and how they will impact Xbox below.

_Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days._

_I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come._

_Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams._

_HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review._

_Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey._

_Phil_

Text: ## "We must make choices now for continued success in future years."

Microsoft has today made significant layoffs to its gaming division, per a memo sent to staff by Xbox boss Phil Spencer and reviewed by IGN.

A source told IGN that Candy Crush developer King was hit hard, but the layoffs affect other parts of the gaming business. IGN understands parts of Microsoft-owned Bethesda, including its London office, were also affected by the cuts. [Rare's long-in-development Xbox game Everwild was canceled as part of the round of layoffs](https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox).

The gaming layoffs come as part of [an eye-watering round of cuts across Microsoft](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/) that amount to 4%, or roughly 9,100 of employees, losing their jobs. Microsoft has over 228,000 employees worldwide.

In the memo, Spencer failed to confirm specifics, telling staff “any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.”

The following message from Phil Spencer was shared to all gaming staff today:

> Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.

> I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.

> Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.

> HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.

> Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.

> Phil

Microsoft staff who wish to remain anonymous to protect their careers told IGN that employees had braced themselves for the layoffs, fearing the worst.

Microsoft has made a huge number of cuts to its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. [It laid off 1,900 staff in January 2024](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce), then made further cuts just a few months later [when it closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda). In September 2024, [Microsoft cut a further 650 staff from its gaming business](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff). And in May this year, [Microsoft cut an eye-watering 6,000 staff](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-cuts-3-of-its-workforce-affecting-thousands-of-staff), or 3% of its entire workforce. Today's round of layoffs is the fourth to hit Microsoft's gaming business in 18 months.

[Speaking to IGN in June](https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024) 2024, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said: "I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make."

The cuts come hot on the heels of [Microsoft's confirmation that it plans to release next-gen Xbox consoles](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library), and has a strong presence at video game show gamescom.

Text: Microsoft confirmed that it’s laying off as many as 9,100 employees, or about 4 percent of its workforce, in yet another round of cuts this year, reports _[The Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/)_. Employees in Microsoft’s Xbox division, known as Microsoft Gaming, are being hit hard by these layoffs, although exact numbers and divisions are not yet known.

Xbox leader Phil Spencer said in a message to the team, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”

_[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division)_ reports that the now Microsoft-owned King division that makes _Candy Crush_ is cutting about 10 percent of employees, or 200 people, while other units, like ZeniMax, have also confirmed they are cutting jobs. Microsoft is also laying off [more than 70 people at its _Forza Motorsport_ studio](https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts), Turn 10, as well as [cancelling its _Perfect Dark_ and _Everwild_ games](https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs). The studio behind _Perfect Dark_, The Initiative, is also closing down as part of these layoffs.

These major layoffs come less than two months after Microsoft announced it was [cutting more than 6,000 employees](https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce), followed by an additional 305 reductions [in early June](https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/678376/microsoft-is-laying-off-300-more-employees). Microsoft employees have faced a series of layoffs over the past year, including a round of [performance-based cuts](https://www.theverge.com/news/604850/microsofts-performance-based-layoffs) that have seriously hit morale, according to multiple Microsoft employees I’ve spoken to.

Microsoft [laid off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs) in January 2024, followed by several game studio closures and job losses in May, and 1,000 job losses from its [HoloLens and Azure cloud teams in June](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170902/microsoft-hololens-2-mixed-reality-azure-layoffs). Microsoft also [laid off 650 more Xbox employees in September](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242695/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-650-employees), as part of a restructuring related to the company’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

This is the memo that Xbox boss Phil Spencer sent to employees:

> Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.

Text: Microsoft is canceling its _Perfect Dark_ and _Everwild_ games as part of sweeping cuts to its Xbox division. Matt Booty, Xbox president of game content and studios, revealed that Microsoft will be closing The Initiative, the studio behind _Perfect Dark_, in an internal memo to Xbox employees today.

The cuts are part of layoffs affecting [around 9,000 employees across Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox), with Turn 10 Studios, the developer behind _Forza Motorsport_, also [hit hard by today’s layoffs](https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts).

Here is Booty’s memo to staff:

> Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units.

> We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.

> Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.

> For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.

> To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we’re taking on the path ahead.

Text: Microsoft is cutting more than 9,000 jobs -- 4% of its global workforce -- and as a result, Everwild and the Perfect Dark reboot have been put out to pasture.

Thomas is a native of upstate New York and a graduate of the University at Albany. As a member of CNET's How To team, he writes about the intersection of policy, information and technology, and how you can best be served in that area. Outside of work, he can most often be found watching too many movies, reading too much, drinking too much coffee, or spending time with his cats.

Microsoft is moving ahead with mass layoffs, cutting a little less than [4% of its workforce or about 9,000 roles](https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-f44079957b12370f72e24edebe9fcc6b) across the company. As a result, multiple [games](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/best-pc-games-right-now/) brewing within Xbox Game Studios were canceled, including some fairly high-profile projects.

When reached for comment, Microsoft directed CNET to [reports Wednesday by Variety](https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-thousands-xbox-gamning-1236446010/), confirming their accuracy.

"To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness," Microsoft Gaming chief Phil Spencer wrote in a staff memo Wednesday morning, as published by Variety.

Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty [confirmed the game cancellations](https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/) in an internal email published by Variety, naming Perfect Dark and Everwild specifically, as well as other "unannounced" titles.

"We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio," Booty wrote in the email. "As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative."

Booty added that the decisions to axe these games "reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination and commitment."

## What Xbox games have been canceled?

Perhaps the most significant title canceled amid these new layoffs was a reboot of the classic FPS series, Perfect Dark. The studio that had been working on this new title, The Initiative, will be shut down entirely.

The long-awaited new entry in the sci-fi espionage series has been in the works since the studio opened in 2018 and first showed off gameplay footage for the title during an Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024.

Another notable title getting the axe is Everwild, a long-gestating new IP from Rare, the revered British studio Sea of Thieves, which Microsoft acquired in 2002. Over the decades, the studio has also produced the original Donkey King Country games for the SNES, the original Perfect Dark for the Nintendo 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day and the Banjo-Kazooie series.

According to unnamed sources who spoke to [Video Games Chronicle](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/), numerous job cuts and a broader restructuring are expected at Rare, resulting in the game's cancellation. The sources also confirmed reports over the years about Everwild's somewhat turbulent development, claiming that it had "struggled to nail down a clear direction for the title."

The game has reportedly been in development for the better part of a decade, being officially announced in 2019, followed by a trailer in 2020. In 2021, reports emerged that development on the game had been "rebooted."

The other title reportedly put out to pasture was an untitled new MMORPG from Zenimax Online Studios, the creator of the popular MMO [Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elder-scrolls-online-high-isle-says-hello-to-intrigue-goodbye-to-cosmic-threats/), which has reportedly reached upward of 25 million players since launching in 2014.

Details about what this title was are sparse, with [Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reporting](https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o) that the game went by the codename "Blackbird" and had been in the works since 2018. Windows Central said in its [report](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative) about Perfect Dark's cancellation that Blackbird was once intended to act as a successor of sorts to Elder Scrolls Online.

David Lumb, a senior reporter at CNET, noted how these new developments at Microsoft underscored the recent job instability in the gaming industry, as well as the uncertainty the cancellations are sure to cause among gamers.

"The biggest losses are to the seemingly thousands of people who are out of a job in a tumultuous industry that's seen record layoffs year over year," Lumb explained, adding, "The cancellations of big games like the upcoming Perfect Dark and Rare's next game Everwild are concerning for Microsoft's next few years of releases, but also to confidence that a game being teased at, say, an Xbox Showcase will end up coming out."

According to Variety, [all games that were shown off during the 2025 Xbox Games Showcase](https://www.cnet.com/news-live/xbox-games-showcase-2025-news-trailers-and-everything-announced/) in June will continue being developed.

[Microsoft Corp.’](https://financialpost.com/tag/microsoft-corp/) s gaming division laid off hundreds of employees on Wednesday, part of a broader culling at the software company as it seeks to control costs.

An Xbox spokesperson declined to confirm how many people were impacted, but the cuts were widespread and significant.

Subsidiaries across the gaming organization were told that they would be affected by the layoffs. Microsoft’s Stockholm-based King division, which makes Candy Crush, is cutting 10 per cent of its staff, or about 200 jobs, according to people familiar with the plans. Other European offices, such as ZeniMax, also began cutting employees early Wednesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

News of further job cuts trickled out slowly as other units of Microsoft Gaming, such as Call of Duty studios Raven Software and Sledgehammer Games as well as Halo Studios and Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 Studios, also announced workforce reductions, according to the people familiar.

The company cancelled several projects that had been in development for years, including the fantasy game Everwild, in development at U.K.-based Rare Studio, and an original new online game from ZeniMax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online. Both of those studios will cut jobs as a result of the cancellations, according to the people.

Xbox also cancelled the planned reboot Perfect Dark and shuttered The Initiative, one of the studios behind it. In an email to staff, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty said that the studio shutdown and project cancellations “reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape.”

Microsoft announced Wednesday that it’s eliminating 9,000 workers companywide in its second wave of layoffs this year. The cuts will have an impact across teams, geographies and tenure, and are being made in an effort to streamline processes and reduce layers of management, a company spokesperson said. The terminations follow an earlier round of 6,000 job cuts in May that fell hardest on product and engineering positions.

The company’s gaming units were expected to be told throughout the day how many jobs would be cut at each office. The division had about 20,000 employees as of January 2024.

“To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Microsoft Gaming chief executive Phil Spencer said in an email to staff seen by Bloomberg News.

Spencer didn’t share specific numbers but said that impacted employees will be “given priority review” if they apply to open jobs elsewhere within the company. He wrote that Microsoft’s “platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger,” but that “we must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities.”

Employees at Xbox had been bracing for the job cuts since May, when Microsoft began conducting companywide layoffs and speculation mounted that the gaming division might be impacted. This is the fourth mass layoff at Xbox in the last 18 months. The gaming division has been under pressure to boost profit margins since Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard for US$69 billion in a deal that closed in October 2023.

Text: UPDATE: "These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved."

Image credit: Microsoft

**UPDATE 5:50pm UK:** [Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has reported](https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l) that more studios have been hit by layoffs. Raven Software, one the developers behind the Call of Duty series, as well as Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10.

According to Schreier, nearly 50 percent of Turn 10 have been impacted by layoffs as part of today's cuts. Figures for Raven Software are uncertain as of writing.

* * *

**ORIGINAL STORY 3:33pm UK:** Microsoft has begun another round of layoffs at Xbox. At the time of writing, Zenimax and King are reportedly affected.

[According to a report by Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division), Microsoft's King division is losing 10 percent of its staff, which comes to roughly 200 people. Staff at Zenimax have also been informed of layoffs across its European offices, though the number of impacted employees is currently unclear.

[According to a report by Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025), Zenimax's London-based marketing team - as well as staff in Rockville, Maryland - are included in these cuts. Meanwhile, a memo [seen by IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff) has been sent around the Xbox gaming division by Phil Spencer, confirming layoffs within the company. You can read it in full below:

"Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organisation. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organisational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.

"I recognise that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritise the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.

"Prioritising our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental - it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.

"HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.

"Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey."

In a subsequent statement shared with Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson said: "We continue to implement organisational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."

These layoffs are part of extensive changes across Microsoft - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html) has reported around 9,000 employees have been cut from across the business. That amounts to around four percent of its global workforce. CNBC also stated Microsoft reported nearly $2.6bn in net income on $70bn in revenue for its March quarter. As such, Microsoft is still ranked as one of the most profitable companies, according to FactSet data.

Word of today's layoffs first began last month, when a report stated [Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution](https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week). At this time, Bloomberg described the then-upcoming redundancies as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.

In May, [Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce](https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report), which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".

Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, sent an email to all Microsoft Gaming employees regarding the layoffs, which was obtained by [_Windows Central_](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025) and confirmed as authentic by Microsoft.

As part of today's layoffs, several games, [including Rare's _Everwild_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everwild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs-162200526.html), have been cancelled and The Initiative, the Xbox studio which was producing the Perfect Dark reboot, has been [shut down](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-the-studio-developing-the-perfect-dark-reboot-and-cancelling-the-game-182257902.html). The news was broken to the team by Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, who said Microsoft "did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."

Here's Matt Booty's full note to staff:

_Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units._

_We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment._

_Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026._

_For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams._

_To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead._

Last year, Microsoft [slashed almost 2,000 jobs](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-slashes-1900-jobs-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard-145304693.html) from its gaming division, affecting employees across Xbox and Activision Blizzard. In the same year, it also [shuttered a trio](https://www.engadget.com/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-have-been-shut-down-183913558.html) of ZeniMax game development teams after having [acquired](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-zenimax-acquisition-approved-eu-us-regulators-105057960.html) the video game holding company in 2021. This will be the fourth round of cuts at Xbox in the last 18 months. These layoffs come against the backdrop of Microsoft’s [$69 billion acquisition](https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-125053787.html) of Activision Blizzard in October 2023.

The gaming industry has had a rocky couple of years, with an [estimated](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eleven-percent-of-game-developers-were-laid-off-in-2024-according-to-gdc-survey-130003228.html) 11 percent of game developers losing their jobs in 2024. Microsoft’s profits have been on a steady upward trajectory, with the company reporting over $25 billion in net income in its last quarterly report. When asked for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson told Engadget that the company "\[continues\] to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace.”

**Update, July 2, 6:45PM ET:** This story has been updated multiple times since publishing to include confirmation of the particulars of the layoffs, the cancellation of several games, the shuttering of The Initiative, and an infuriatingly vague comment from a Microsoft spokesperson.

Text: Skyrocketing cloud services revenues and customers' AI investments helped bring Microsoft's latest quarterly earnings to $65.6 billion. Microsoft on Wednesday revealed financial results for its fiscal year 2025 first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Overall Microsoft revenue for the quarter totaled $61.9 billion, an increase of 17%. Perhaps more importantly, revenue growth in the company's hyperscaler business is helping leadership make the case that its investments in infrastructure for artificial intelligence solutions are paying off. Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said Microsoft expects its AI practice to log an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion in the next quarter. That would occur in record time for any Microsoft business. “AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process," Nadella said in a statement. “We are expanding our opportunity and winning new customers as we help them apply our AI platforms and tools to drive new growth and operating leverage.” Microsoft's Satya Nadella Microsoft Cloud Revenue and AI The intelligent cloud unit of Microsoft, which contains public cloud platform Azure, grew 20% year-over-year to $24.1 billion for the IT giant, outpacing Microsoft's productivity ($28.3 billion) and personal computing ($13.2 billion) businesses. Azure and "other cloud services" specifically grew 33% from a year prior. Related: Investors to Microsoft: Where's the AI Payoff? The OpenAI investor attributed 12 percentage points of growth to its AI services, and executives hailed the numbers as a validation for their steep investments in AI infrastructure. Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage decreased from 73% to 71% year-over-year "driven by scaling our AI infrastructure." "We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand signals. As I said last quarter, we will stay aligned, and if needed adjust, to the demand signals we see," Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood said in the earnings call. "As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases." Executives told investors that demand for Microsoft AI solutions currently exceeds the vendor's capacity. Nadella said Azure OpenAI usage has increased by more than double over the last half-year. On the productivity side, commercial revenue for Microsoft 365 (which includes the OpenAI-based Copilot tool) grew 13%, and seats grew by 8%. Daily Microsoft 365 Copilot users are doubling quarter-over-quarter, Nadella said. Related: Brutal Day on Wall Street Raises 'AI Bubble' Concerns for Nvidia, More Commercial bookings across the portfolio grew 30%, with Microsoft citing "large, long-term Azure contracts." Microsoft did note, however, that enterprise and partner services revenue declined 1%. Google Cloud Sees Similar Boost Rival hyperscaler platform Google Cloud also celebrated its gains this week. Google Cloud accounted for $11.4 billion of parent company Alphabet's $88.3 billion in the quarter, but Google Cloud revenues grew 35%. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichair noted that Google Cloud is tapping into AI through infrastructure, its Vertix platform for customizing foundational models, the Gemini-connected BigQuery data platform, AI-based cybersecurity offerings, and most recently a customer engagement suite. "Our technology leadership and AI portfolio are helping us attract new customers, win larger deals, and drive 30% deeper product adoption with existing customers," Pichair said in the earnings call. Amazon Web Services (AWS), another popular hyperscaler, will announce its earnings on Thursday.

Text: By integrating Microsoft’s cloud and AI tools, FNZ is aiming to close that gap and bring its digital roadmap forward at scale.

Microsoft will allow its cloud rivals to offer ‘pay-as-you-go’ software to their customers after bowing to pressure over its licensing practices.

The US tech giant attracted criticism for the way it offered exclusive software deals to customers of its Azure cloud platform, which rivals said made it difficult for them to compete.

But in a deal struck with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), a group representing European cloud providers, [CISPE](https://cispe.cloud/) members will now be able to offer Microsoft software to their customers on a pay-as-you-go basis, producing pricing conditions more comparable to those offered by Azure.

CISPE members will be able to offer the software without sharing customer details with Microsoft – addressing a core concern raised by the group.

“The agreement we reached with Microsoft marks a significant breakthrough in our long-standing efforts to ensure a level playing field,” said Francisco Mingorance, secretary general of CISPE.

“For enterprise customers, the new programs directly address previous concerns of CISPE members and empowers European enterprises to choose among a wide range of cloud solutions that meet their sovereignty, compliance, and economic needs.”

Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.

## Cloud market probe

The cloud practices of the $3tn tech firm have [come under intense scrutiny](https://www.cityam.com/microsoft-facing-1bn-overcharging-claim-from-uk-firms/) in recent months, including by major rivals Google and AWS.

Responding to a [UK competition watchdog probe](https://www.uktech.news/cloud/unhappy-with-conduct-google-amazon-take-aim-at-microsofts-cloud-practices-20240916) into behaviours in the cloud market, Google said that Microsoft’s licensing restrictions prevent it and others from competing for most of this addressable market, adding: “urgent and timely action is necessary to address Microsoft’s practices.”

Amazon’s AWS said there is “a history of cloud providers and customers being unhappy with Microsoft’s conduct,” adding that Microsoft’s “conduct is artificially imposed and could be easily fixed”.

Microsoft insisted that the cloud market “is highly dynamic and rapidly evolving”.

“Customer satisfaction is high, there is fierce competition between cloud service providers which drives down prices, and market participants are investing heavily in AI capabilities to stay relevant and competitive,” Microsoft added.

Microsoft said licence fees for its software do not materially raise costs for its competitors, adding that the available evidence indicates that AWS and Google have ample margin to compete with its Azure platform.

“We remain steadfast in our commitment to empower our partners and customers with greater choice and control over their data. By working closely with CISPE and our European partner community, we strive to innovate our products, business models, and strengthen our opportunities together,” Lars Johnson, General Manager of Business Planning at Microsoft, said.

 Microsoft Connected Cache Now Available for Enterprise Use 
 
 
 
 Microsoft this week announced the general availability of Microsoft Connected Cache (MCC), a built-in Windows capability aimed at reducing Internet bandwidth usage by storing Microsoft content locally within an enterprise's network. 
 According to the company, the feature is now fully supported and ready for enterprise deployment across Windows 10 and Windows 11 environments. 
 "As more organizations move to a cloud-native approach to device management, Internet bandwidth consumption has become a major pain point," said Microsoft. "Without on-premises distribution points running Configuration Manager, customers have seen their network bandwidth consumption skyrocket as all their devices attempt to download updates directly from Windows Update over the Internet." 
 MCC operates by caching content from Microsoft content delivery networks (CDNs) locally within an organization's premises. This includes content from Windows Update, Microsoft Store, Windows Autopilot, Intune and Microsoft Defender updates. 
 Once enabled, MCC automatically downloads and stores content requested by devices on the network. Subsequent devices receive the same content from the local cache, minimizing Internet usage and download redundancy. 
 Microsoft noted that MCC only caches content that has been previously requested by devices within the same organization and does not prefetch data or act as a proxy. 
 MCC is included with Windows 10 version 2004 and later, as well as Windows 11, and does not require additional software installation. The feature leverages Delivery Optimization (DO) as its download protocol and is managed via Microsoft Intune or Group Policy. 
 
 Microsoft confirmed that MCC is available for the following editions: 
 
 Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, Education. 
 Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, Education. 
 
 MCC is not supported on Windows Server editions or Home editions. 
 Microsoft Connected Cache requirements include: 
 
 Systems running Windows 10 version 2004 (or later) or Windows 11. 
 Delivery Optimization must be enabled. 
 Devices must be on the same physical network as the MCC host. 
 The MCC host must be a device running Windows 10 or 11 with at least 8 GB RAM and 100 GB of available disk space. 
 
 The feature is enabled and managed through Microsoft Intune, using the "Delivery Optimization" settings, and the group policy is applied via the "Enable Microsoft Connected Cache" policy. Microsoft also published deployment guidance and performance monitoring tips on its documentation site. 
 MCC was initially available only through Microsoft Connected Cache server software for ISPs and large enterprises. The GA version now provides the same functionality without requiring separate server infrastructure. 
 Microsoft said MCC is intended for use in branch offices, school labs, and other locations with limited or costly Internet bandwidth. 
 To ensure that only authorized devices can access cached content, MCC uses network boundary identification and security tokens. Cached content is encrypted and cannot be accessed directly without the proper DO request headers.

Text: Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella (L) returns to the stage after a pre-recorded interview during the Microsoft Build conference opening keynote in Seattle, Washington on May 19, 2025. Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty Images Microsoft on Friday revised its practices to ensure that engineers in China no longer provide technical support to U.S. defense clients using the company's cloud services. The company implemented the changes in an effort to reduce national security and cybersecurity risks stemming from its cloud work with a major customer. The announcement came days after ProPublica published an extensive report describing the Defense Department's dependence on Microsoft software engineers in China. "In response to concerns raised earlier this week about US-supervised foreign engineers, Microsoft has made changes to our support for US Government customers to assure that no China-based engineering teams are providing technical assistance for DoD Government cloud and related services," Frank Shaw, the Microsoft's chief communications officer, wrote in a Friday X post. The change impacts the work of Microsoft's Azure cloud services division, which analysts estimate now generates more than 25% of the company's revenue. That makes Azure bigger than Google Cloud but smaller than Amazon Web Services. Microsoft receives "substantial revenue from government contracts," according to its most recent quarterly earnings statement, and more than half of the company's $70 billion in first-quarter revenue came from customers based in the U.S. In 2019, Microsoft won a $10 billion cloud-related defense contract, but the Pentagon wound up canceling it in 2021 after a legal battle. In 2022, the department gave cloud contracts worth up to $9 billion in total to Amazon, Google, Oracle and Microsoft. ProPublica reported that the work of Microsoft's Chinese Azure engineers is overseen by "digital escorts" in the U.S., who typically have less technical prowess than the employees they manage overseas. The report detailed how the "digital escort" arrangement might leave the U.S. vulnerable to a cyberattack from China. "This is obviously unacceptable, especially in today's digital threat environment," Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a video posted to X on Friday. He described the architecture as "a legacy system created over a decade ago, during the Obama administration." The Defense Department will review its systems in search for similar activity, Hegseth said. Microsoft originally told ProPublica that its employees and contractors were adhering to U.S. government rules. "We remain committed to providing the most secure services possible to the US government, including working with our national security partners to evaluate and adjust our security protocols as needed," Shaw wrote.

Last week, Microsoft announced that it would no longer use China-based engineering teams to support the Defense Department’s cloud computing systems, following [ProPublica’s investigation of the practice](https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-digital-escorts-pentagon-defense-department-china-hackers), which cybersecurity experts said could expose the government to hacking and espionage.

But it turns out the Pentagon was not the only part of the government facing such a threat. For years, Microsoft has also used its global workforce, including China-based personnel, to maintain the cloud systems of other federal departments, including parts of Justice, [Treasury](https://www.irs.gov/pub/foia/ig/spder/pgld-10-0724-0018-public.pdf) and [Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/opog/OSCSP_OS-071_PTA_FY21.pdf), ProPublica has found.

This work has taken place in what’s known as the Government Community Cloud, which is intended for information that is not classified but is nonetheless sensitive. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, the US government’s cloud accreditation organization, has approved GCC to handle “moderate” impact information “where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effect on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals.”

The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division [has used](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/page/file/1470301/dl) GCC to support its criminal and civil investigation and litigation functions, according to a 2022 report. Parts of the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/08/12/2024-16354/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records) and the [Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/media/document/piaedcapshdpdf-53814.pdf) have also used GCC.

Microsoft says its foreign engineers working in GCC have been overseen by US-based personnel known as “digital escorts,” similar to the system it had in place at the Defense Department.

Nevertheless, cybersecurity experts told ProPublica that foreign support for GCC presents an opportunity for spying and sabotage. “There’s a misconception that, if government data isn’t classified, no harm can come of its distribution,” said Rex Booth, a former federal cybersecurity official who now is chief information security officer of the tech company SailPoint.

“With so much data stored in cloud services—and the power of AI to analyze it quickly—even unclassified data can reveal insights that could harm US interests,” he said.

Harry Coker, who was a senior executive at the CIA and the National Security Agency, said foreign intelligence agencies could leverage information gleaned from GCC systems to “swim upstream” to more sensitive or even classified ones. “It is an opportunity that I can’t imagine an intelligence service not pursuing,” he said.

[The Office of the Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf) has deemed China the “most active and persistent cyber threat to US Government, private-sector, and critical infrastructure networks.” Laws there grant the country’s officials broad authority to collect data, and experts say it is difficult for any Chinese citizen or company to meaningfully resist a direct request from security forces or law enforcement.

Microsoft declined interview requests for this story. In response to questions, the tech giant issued a statement that suggested it would be discontinuing its use of China-based support for GCC, as it recently did for the Defense Department’s cloud systems.

“Microsoft took steps last week to enhance the security of our DoD Government cloud offerings. Going forward, we are taking similar steps for all our government customers who use Government Community Cloud to further ensure the security of their data,” the statement said. A spokesperson declined to elaborate on what those steps are.

The company also said that over the next month it “will conduct a review to assess whether additional measures are needed.”

The federal departments and agencies that ProPublica found to be using GCC did not respond to requests for comment.

The latest revelations about Microsoft’s use of its Chinese workforce to service the US government—and the company’s swift response—are likely to fuel [a rapidly developing firestorm in Washington](https://www.propublica.org/article/defense-department-pentagon-microsoft-digital-escort-china), where federal lawmakers and the Trump administration are questioning the tech giant’s cybersecurity practices and trying to contain any potential national security fallout. “Foreign engineers—from any country, including of course China—should NEVER be allowed to maintain or access DoD systems,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [wrote in a post on X](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1946226166282527037?s=19) last Friday.

Last week, ProPublica revealed that Microsoft has for a decade relied on foreign workers—including those based in China—to maintain the Defense Department’s computer systems, with oversight coming from US-based digital escorts. But those escorts, we found, often don’t have the advanced technical expertise to police foreign counterparts with far more advanced skills, leaving highly sensitive information vulnerable. In response to the reporting, Hegseth [launched a review](https://x.com/SecDef/status/1946324468898426899) of the practice.

ProPublica found that Microsoft developed the escort arrangement to satisfy Defense Department officials who were concerned about the company’s foreign employees, given the department’s citizenship requirements for people handling sensitive data. Microsoft went on to win federal cloud computing business and has said in [earnings reports](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000789019/000095017025061046/msft-20250331.htm) that it receives “substantial revenue from government contracts.”

While Microsoft has said it will stop using China-based tech support for the Defense Department, it declined to answer questions about what would replace it, including whether cloud support would come from engineers based outside the US. The company also declined to say whether it would continue to use digital escorts.

Microsoft confirmed to ProPublica this week that a similar escorting arrangement had been used in GCC — a dynamic that surprised some former government officials and cybersecurity experts. “In an increasingly complex digital world, consumers of cloud products deserve to know how their data is handled and by whom,” Booth said. “The cybersecurity industry depends on clarity.”

Microsoft said it disclosed details of the GCC escort arrangement in documentation submitted to the federal government as part of the FedRAMP cloud accreditation process. The company declined to provide the documents to ProPublica, citing the potential security risk of publicly disclosing them, and also declined to say whether the China-based location of its support personnel was specifically mentioned in them.

ProPublica contacted other major cloud services providers to the federal government to ask whether they use China-based support. A spokesperson for Amazon Web Services said in a statement that “AWS does not use personnel in China to support federal contracts.” A Google spokesperson said in a statement that “Google Public Sector does not have a Digital Escort program. Instead, its sensitive systems are supported by fully trained personnel who meet the U.S. government’s location, citizenship and security clearance requirements.” Oracle said it “does not use any Chinese support for US federal customers.”

Microsoft is starting to test updates to the Xbox PC app and Xbox consoles that will allow cloud games to follow you across devices. A new play history section of the Xbox PC app and Xbox console home UI will display cloud games as part of the recently played titles list and this will roam across Xbox consoles, PCs, and handhelds.

Cloud-playable games are now starting to show inside play history or the library on the Xbox PC app. “This includes all cloud playable titles, even console exclusives spanning from the original Xbox to Xbox Series X\|S, whether you own the title or access it through Game Pass,” [explains Lily Wang](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/21/now-available-for-xbox-insiders-your-cross-device-play-history-and-easier-access-to-your-cloud-playable-console-games-on-pc/), product manager of Xbox experiences.

Your recent games, including cloud ones, will soon follow you across devices — complete with cloud-powered game saves. So if you played an Xbox game on your console that’s not natively available on PC, it will still show up in your recent games list and be playable through Xbox Cloud Gaming on Windows.

Cloud-playable games on the Xbox PC app can be found from a new filter in the library section, and a new “play history” section will appear at the end of the “jump back in” list on the home screen of the Xbox PC app. “While the large tiles highlight games you’ve recently played on your current device, the play history tile shows games you’ve played across any Xbox device, making it easy to pick up where you left off,” says Wang.

This same play history section will appear on the main Xbox console interface, too — which could mean we’ll eventually see PC games listed here and playable through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft currently uses the chips from Xbox Series X to power special server blades for Xbox Cloud Gaming, but internal emails in the _FTC v. Microsoft_ case in 2023 revealed that Microsoft has been investigating [streaming PC games over the cloud](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878376/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-pc-games-streaming-ftc-documents). With Microsoft moving Xbox and PC closer together for its next-gen consoles, I’m expecting to see Xbox Cloud Gaming support PC games and provide better bitrates and resolutions, too.

Business reporter and North America technology correspondent

Chinese "threat actors" have hacked some Microsoft SharePoint servers and targeted the data of the businesses using them, the firm has said.

China state-backed Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon as well as China-based Storm-2603 were said to have "exploited vulnerabilities" in on-premises SharePoint servers, the kind used by firms, but not in its cloud-based service.

The US tech giant has released security updates in response and has advised all on-premises SharePoint server customers to install them.

"China firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cyber crime," China's US embassy spokesman said in a statement.

"At the same time, we also firmly oppose smearing others without solid evidence," continued Liu Pengyu in the statement posted on X.

Microsoft said it had "high confidence" the hackers would continue to target systems which have not installed its security updates.

"Investigations into other actors also using these exploits are still ongoing," Microsoft said in a statement.

It added that it would update its [website blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/) with more information as its investigation continues.

Microsoft said it had observed attacks in which hackers had sent a request to a SharePoint server "enabling the theft of the key material by threat actors".

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said this included "a limited number" of SharePoint Server customers in the UK.

Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer at Mandiant Consulting firm, a division of Google Cloud, told BBC News it was "aware of several victims in several different sectors across a number of global geographies".

Carmakal said it appeared that governments and businesses that use SharePoint on their sites were the primary target.

A number of adversaries who stole material encoded by cryptography were then able to regain ongoing access to the victims' SharePoint data, he said.

"This was exploited in a very broad way, very opportunistically before a patch was made available. That's why this is significant," Carmakal said.

Carmakal said the "China-nexus actor" was deploying techniques similar to previous campaigns associated with Beijing.

Microsoft said Linen Typhoon had "focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defence, strategic planning, and human rights" for 13 years.

It added that Violet Typhoon had been "dedicated to espionage", primarily targeting former government and military staff, non-governmental organizations, think tanks, higher education, the media, the financial sector and the health sector in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

Meanwhile, Storm-2603 was "assessed with medium confidence to be a China-based threat actor".

Following criticism of the company’s use of Chinese workers to advise on operation of Department of Defense cloud systems, Microsoft has changed its policy. 
 
 
 
 Microsoft has moved to exclude engineers in China from working on the cloud services it provides to the US Department of Defense, days after saying that such global support personnel did not have direct access to its customers’ data or systems. 
 The company’s use of Chinese engineers to work on DoD infrastructure under the supervision of US-based “digital escorts” was uncovered in a report published by investigative news agency ProPublica last Tuesday. 
 By Friday, though, Microsoft had taken steps to prevent Chinese workers getting even that one-step-removed access to US DoD systems, said the company’s Chief Communications Officer, Frank X. Shaw. 
 
 
 “In response to concerns raised earlier this week about US-supervised foreign engineers, Microsoft has made changes to our support for US Government customers to assure that no China-based engineering teams are providing technical assistance for DoD Government cloud and related services. We remain committed to providing the most secure services possible to the US government, including working with our national security partners to evaluate and adjust our security protocols as needed,” Shaw posted on X (formerly Twitter) late Friday. 
 Shaw did not say that that China-based engineering teams would be excluded from work on non-cloud-related Department of Defense projects, nor that they would be kept away from work for other US government departments or for governments of other countries. 
 The company had initially swept aside concerns about the use of Chinese worker on DoD systems, saying the global subject matter experts it relied on for support had no direct access to customer data or systems, and that they worked through authorized US personnel in accordance with US Government requirements and processes. “Only authorized US persons with the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment,” a company spokesperson said. 
 
 
 The company’s global support personnel — of which the Chinese engineers at issue are just part — work on DoD systems under the supervision of government-approved “digital escorts” but the escorts often lack the skills to monitor the work effectively, the July 15 report by investigative news service ProPublica said. 
 “We’re trusting that what they’re doing isn’t malicious, but we really can’t tell,” Propublica quoted one of the escorts as saying.

[AI in practice](https://the-decoder.com/artificial-intelligence-news/ai-practice/)

Jul 27, 2025Jul 27, 2025

GPT-Image-1 prompted by THE DECODER

Matthias is the co-founder and publisher of THE DECODER, exploring how AI is fundamentally changing the relationship between humans and computers.

**Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sets a new course for the company, aiming to move beyond traditional software and become an "intelligence engine" for the world's eight billion people.**

"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools," Nadella writes in a [company blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/) marking the start of Microsoft's new financial year.

The old "software factory" vision, first outlined by Bill Gates, no longer fits the moment, Nadella argues. Instead, Microsoft wants to enable individuals and organizations to create their own digital tools using AI. "Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them," Nadella explains.

To make this shift, Microsoft is overhauling its technology stack, starting with core infrastructure and extending up to its AI products, Nadella says. The strategy is to identify and build the essential components—or "platform primitives"—that AI applications need, so developers and companies can use these as a foundation for their own tools and services. "Getting both the product and platform right for the AI wave is our North Star," Nadella writes.

## Microsoft cuts 15,000 jobs despite strong results

Despite strong results, [Microsoft has cut about 15,000 jobs this year](https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-f44079957b12370f72e24edebe9fcc6b), affecting a range of divisions, with the gaming segment taking a particularly hard hit. That amounts to roughly four percent of the company's global workforce.

Nadella frames the layoffs as part of a larger shakeup across the tech industry, where the old idea of guaranteed franchise value no longer applies. For Microsoft—a company that practically defined the concept of a software franchise through the business lock-in of Windows and Office—this marks a sharp break from the past.

He sees the current wave of reorganizations as an effort to position Microsoft for whatever comes next, drawing a parallel to the 1990s, when the company had to adapt as PCs and productivity software went mainstream.

"It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding," Nadella writes.

- Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says the company aims to shift from being a traditional software vendor to an "intelligence engine," helping everyone build their own digital tools using AI.
- Nadella emphasizes that the old model of a "software factory" is outdated, and Microsoft now wants to enable individuals and organizations to create custom solutions with AI agents for tasks like research, analysis, and coding.
- The company is making significant job cuts despite strong financial results, which Nadella frames as necessary steps in this transformation process.

Microsoft has a new experiment, called Copilot Appearance, that's designed to bring its [AI assistant](https://www.zdnet.com/article/8-ways-i-use-microsofts-copilot-vision-ai-to-save-time-on-my-phone-and-pc/) to life -- visually, anyway.

**Also:** [**Microsoft's Copilot Vision can now see and analyze your entire Windows desktop**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-copilot-vision-can-now-see-and-analyze-your-entire-pc-screen-not-just-whats-in-edge/)

Available now as an early preview in Copilot Labs, this feature layers real‑time facial expressions and non‑verbal cues onto Copilot's voice interactions. The goal is to make conversations with Microsoft's AI feel more natural, human‑like, and animated.

## What is Copilot Appearance?

Copilot Appearance is a web-based experiment for Microsoft Copilot that animates the AI assistant with real‑time expressions -- it smiles, nods, and is generally expressive while speaking to you. Think of it as giving Copilot its own little face and presence.

Microsoft

## What exactly does Copilot Appearance do?

Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO, describes Copilot Appearance as a digital buddy that ages alongside you.

On an episode of [The Colin & Samir Show](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oujg9iGznpDFM8SikMFgL?si=ri5iumCrQuWaA7n7tlaN3w&nd=1&dlsi=fb69a3ec0b654f35), he explained how Copilot will have its own "room" to live in and may develop a bit of "digital patina" over time. "I'm really interested in this idea of digital patina. The things I love in my world are the things that are a little bit worn or rubbed down, and have scuff marks," he said. "Unfortunately, in the digital world, we don't have a sense of age."

**Also:** [**Microsoft's big AI update for Windows 11 is here - what's new**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-big-ai-update-for-windows-11-is-here-whats-new/)

For now, Copilot Appearance can smile, nod, and even raise an eyebrow, all while using the same voice you've come to know. It's strictly a web‑only experiment, as Microsoft hasn't announced any plans for Windows or mobile integration just yet.

### Key features

- **Real‑time expressions:** Smiles, nods, raised eyebrows, looks of surprise, etc.
- **Synchronized voice:** Uses Copilot's synthesized speech engine, so expressions match the tone and pace of its responses.
- **Conversational memory:** Remembers earlier parts of your chat, and can reference prior topics.

Microsoft

## How to try Copilot Appearance

Copilot Appearance isn't widely available in [M365 Copilot plans](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/the-microsoft-365-copilot-launch-was-a-total-disaster/) yet. Right now, it is available only to a subset of consumers (no enterprise or business accounts) in the US, UK, and Canada who have been invited into the test flight via Copilot Labs.

[Copilot Labs](https://copilot.microsoft.com/labs) is Microsoft's experimental program, similar to Google Labs. It allows a select group of Copilot subscribers to test early generative AI features and tools before they're released broadly or to the public. Access to Labs isn't guaranteed -- you'll need a Copilot Pro plan (at $20 per month) just to be eligible for beta previews like Copilot Appearance.

**Also:** [**How to remove Copilot from your Microsoft 365 plan - before you have to pay for it**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-remove-copilot-from-your-microsoft-365-plan-before-you-have-to-pay-for-it/)

Once you're in the test group, you'll see a Copilot Appearance option on the web version of Copilot. If you don't see the Appearance toggle, you're not in the test cohort yet, so just keep an eye on Copilot Labs for updates.

### Enabling Copilot Appearance

1. Go to [copilot.microsoft.com](http://copilot.microsoft.com) and sign into your account.
2. From the [Chat pane](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/xy8Ts3FVstBw4AtnHu5t8), enter Voice mode by clicking the microphone icon.
3. Click the gear icon to open Voice settings.
4. Toggle on Appearance.
5. Say "hi" or ask a question -- and watch Copilot light up with expressions.

If you want to stop using Copilot Appearance, just revisit Voice settings in Copilot's web interface and toggle Appearance off at any time. You'll revert to the classic, audio‑only Copilot experience.

Microsoft

## What's next for Copilot Appearance?

Microsoft is gathering feedback via its [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/go-copilot). Look for refinements and potentially a broader rollout based on user response. If you're part of the preview, your bug reports and ideas could directly influence the next version of Copilot Appearance.

Text: In This Article: Microsoft CEO makes bold statement on company's future originally appeared on TheStreet. In a candid memo released July 24, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed what he called the issue "weighing heavily" on him: the company’s ongoing layoffs. More than 15,000 Microsoft employees have been let go in 2025 alone, as part of what Nadella described as a necessary but painful restructuring in the age of AI. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰 The company also cut nearly 2,000 additional staff deemed "low performers" earlier this year. "I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations," he wrote. Related: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that ChatGPT is not the way to superintelligence Recall Nadella wrote a similar note in 2023 — shortly after the company paused raises and announced its first significant layoffs of the post-pandemic era. He faced criticism at the time for placing too much focus on the company's outperformance without acknowledging those difficult moves. Despite the cuts, investors have rewarded Microsoft’s leaner operating model. The company’s stock closed above $500 for the first time on July 9, a symbolic milestone that arguably underscores Wall Street’s growing faith in Microsoft’s AI strategy. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes technology progress isn't linear. Image source: Ben Kriemann/Getty Images In his July memo, Nadella used stark language to describe the current environment, stating: "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." "Progress isn't linear," he added. "It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before." For the past decade, Microsoft  ( MSFT)  has operated under a unifying purpose: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. But Nadella says that vision now needs to evolve. Related: Analysts unveil bold Amazon stock price target before earnings "We must reimagine our mission for a new era," he wrote. "What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools." This shift reflects the company’s broader transformation from a software-centric business to what Nadella calls an "intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve." Microsoft's strategy hinges on positioning itself at the center of the AI value chain. Its Azure cloud platform is rapidly becoming the infrastructure of choice for AI workloads. OpenAI, as well as other major AI labs and enterprises, use Microsoft's GPU-centric cloud services to train and deploy large models.

Text: Microsoft’s Mustafa Suleyman on why orchestrated AI system outperforms human doctors on complex diagnoses.

### The Gist

- **AI beats doctors at diagnosis.** _Microsoft’s MAI-DxO system solved 85.5% of complex cases, a fourfold improvement over human doctors._
- **Orchestration is the secret weapon.** _The system uses multiple specialized AI agents debating and collaborating in real time to improve accuracy and efficiency._
- **Doctors still matter — just differently.** _Suleyman says AI can enhance education, reduce costs and anxiety, while humans retain the role of empathetic guide and judgment provider._

As AI models get commoditized, the value will be added in that final layer of orchestration, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman says.

Microsoft earlier this month [announced](https://microsoft.ai/new/the-path-to-medical-superintelligence/) it built an AI diagnostician that outperforms human doctors on complex cases.

The system, called MAI-DxO, uses two bots to sort through a patient’s medical history and solves 85.5% of patient cases when paired with OpenAI’s o3 model. The results are a major leap above the 20% average accuracy that human doctors achieved on the same cases, although the humans were restricted from [searching the web](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/preparing-for-2025-will-ai-search-be-the-david-to-googles-goliath/) or speaking with colleagues.

In an in-depth conversation shortly after Microsoft announced the results, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman shared how the AI diagnostician was able to 4X the performance of human doctors, what it means for the future of medicine, and whether this is a positive trend for society.

You can read our full conversation below, edited lightly for length and clarity.

## AI-Driven Search Transforms Healthcare Queries

**Alex Kantrowitz: Hi Mustafa, good to see you again. First off, Copilot and Bing now field 50 million medical queries per day. Is that good?**

Mustafa Suleyman: It's incredible, because we're already making access to information super cheap and concise with just search engines. And now with Copilot, answers are much more conversational. You can tone them down so they suit your specific level of knowledge and expertise, and as a result, more and more people are asking Copilot and Bing health-related questions.

The queries range from anything from a cancer issue that someone's dealing with, to a death in a family, to a mental health issue, to just having a skin rash. And so the variety is huge, but obviously we've got a really important objective here to try and improve the quality of our consumer health products.

**Do the health questions that come into [chatbots](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-conversational-ai-is-so-much-more-than-a-chatbot/) look different from search?**

Copilot's answers tend to be more succinct and responsive to the style and tone of the individual person asking the question, and that tends to encourage people to ask a second follow-up question. So it turns it into more of a dialog or a consultation that you might end up having with your doctor. So they are quite different to a normal search query.

## Inside Microsoft’s Two-Bot Diagnostic System

**Speaking of dialogs, let's discuss Microsoft’s new AI diagnostician system. It's actually two bots, where one bot acts as a gatekeeper to all a patient's medical information, and the other asks questions about that history and makes a diagnosis. You’ve found the system performs better than humans in diagnosing disease.**

That's exactly right. We essentially wanted to simulate what it would be like for an AI to act as a diagnostician, to ask the patient a series of questions, to draw out their case history, go through a whole bunch of tests that they may have had — pathology and radiology — and then iteratively examine the information that it's getting in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of its prediction about what your diagnosis actually is.

We actually use the New England Journal of Medicine case histories, hundreds of these past cases. One of these cases comes out every single week, and it's like an ultimate crossword for doctors. They don't see the answer until the following week. And it's a big guessing game to go back through five to seven pages of very detailed history, and then try to figure out what the diagnosis actually turns out to be.

## The Orchestration Layer Is Where Value Emerges

**I thought one of the benefits of generative AI is it can take in a lot of information and then come to answers — often in one shot. What’s the benefit of having multiple bots sort through it?**

The big breakthrough of the last six months or so in AI is these thinking or reasoning models that can query other agents, or find other information sources at inference time, to improve the quality of its response. Rather than just giving the first best answer, it instead goes and consults a range of different sources, and that improves the quality of the information that it finally gets to. So we see that this orchestrator, which under the hood uses four different models from the major providers, can actually improve the accuracy of each of the individual models. And collectively, all of them together by a very significant degree, about 10% or so. So it's a big step forward. And I think that as the AI models get commoditized, really, all the value will be added in that final layer of orchestration, product integration, and that's what we're seeing with this diagnostic orchestrator.

## MAI-DxO Beats Human Doctors by 4X in Accuracy

**So it’s a 10% increase in accurately diagnosing on top of the standard LLMs?**

Yes. And in fact, we actually benchmark that against human performance. So we had a whole bunch of expert physicians play this simulated diagnosis environment game, and they, on average, get about one in five, right? So about 20%. Whereas our orchestrator gets about 85% accuracy, so it's four times more accurate, which, in my career, I've never seen such a big gulf between human level performance and the AI system's performance.

Many years ago, I worked on lots of diagnoses for radiology and head and neck cancer and mammography, and the goal was just to take a single radiology exam and predict, does it have cancer? And that was the most we could do. Whereas now it's actually producing a very detailed diagnosis, and doing that sequentially through this interactive dialog mechanism. And so that massively improves the accuracy.

## Doctors Can Learn From AI’s Diagnostic Thinking

**What if you have the same thing happen to medicine as is happening with beginner level code, where people learn to code using copilots, but when something breaks, it becomes harder for them to figure out what's going on. If you're a doctor, if you outsource some of your thinking to these bots, is that a problem?**

So this isn't just giving a black box answer. That's why the sequential diagnosis part is so important, because you can watch the AI in real time, ask questions of the case history, get an answer, shape a new question, get an answer, present a new question, then ask for a different type of testing, get those results, interpret it, then give an answer.

The dialogic nature means that a human doctor can follow along and actually learn in a very transparent way. It's almost like having an interpretability mechanism inside the black box of the LLM, because you can see its thinking process in real time. And in fact, you don't just see the chain of thought which is the inner monologue.

We've actually created five different types of agent which all have a debate, and we call this chain of debate. They negotiate with one another. They try to prioritize certain different aspects, like cost or efficiency. And the coordination of those different skill sets among the agents is actually what makes this so effective.

### How MAI-DxO Works and Why It Matters

_A summary of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman’s key points about the diagnostic system._

| Feature | Description | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dual-bot architecture | One AI agent retrieves patient data; another interrogates the case and makes the diagnosis | Simulates a clinical dialogue for better accuracy and transparency |
| Agent orchestration | Five specialized agents debate and collaborate during diagnosis | Boosts accuracy by 10% beyond LLMs; enables nuanced decision-making |
| Performance vs. humans | 85.5% diagnostic accuracy compared to 20% for expert doctors | Fourfold improvement over average physician performance |
| Educational value | Doctors can follow AI's logic and learn from rare case detection | Enhances medical training and clinical exposure |
| Cost optimization | AI selects minimum necessary tests to reach accurate diagnoses | Reduces test burden, patient anxiety, and overall care costs |
| Future use | Still in research phase; potential for hospital integration | Aims for wide deployment across medical platforms and queries |

## AI Can Detect Rare Diseases Doctors May Never See

**Even if a doctor can watch this take place, it turns their role in diagnoses from active to somewhat positive. Is there some benefit in having the doctor work in that active phase vs. watching bots have a conversation?**

I think that's totally true. I just still think this is going to be an amazing education tool for doctors to actually learn about the breadth of cases they never would have encountered. For example, we actually ran the orchestrator last week on the most recent case study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and it correctly diagnosed the case that had only ever been seen 1,500 times in all of medical literature. It was such an obscure, long tail disease, so very few doctors are ever going to get the chance to see that. And so the ability to accurately detect these kinds of conditions in the wild, in production, I think, will massively outweigh the risk of doctors not being able to sort of exercise in the way that you describe.

Learning Opportunities

I think the tools just change how you work. And everyone will have to adapt to that over time, but the utility is just so unquestionably beneficial that I think it makes it worthwhile.

## Why Training Data Doesn’t Explain This Performance

**Is it able to do that because the cases are in the training data. And even if they are, does it really matter?**

Well, part of the reason why we partnered with the New England Journal of Medicine is because each week, they put out a brand new case which has never even been digitized. So there's no question that it's not in the training data. This case, for example, from last week — there's absolutely no way it's in the training data, because it literally just got published. So we think that's the case going back for all of the previous cases too. So I don't think there's any chance of that. This really is doing an abstraction of judgment. It's not just reproducing training data. It is actually doing some kind of inference or thinking based on the knowledge that it does already have.

## Why Orchestrators May Outperform Single Models

**Your system didn’t show as big of an improvement over reasoning models as it did over standard [LLMs](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/what-are-large-language-models-llms-definition-types-uses/). Is it possible that state-of-the-art reasoning models will learn how to do stuff like this, and you won't need this type of specialized sequencing to achieve similar results?**

The real value here, long term, is in how you orchestrate a variety of different models with different types of expertise. So each one of these five agents has been prompted and designed to have a different type of expertise and then have them jointly, negotiate, and reason collectively. It may be the case that maybe they all get subsumed into a single model in the future. I don't know. Right now, it doesn't look like that. Right now, orchestrators are able to drive much bigger gains.

The other thing that we see, for example, is that it's able to optimize for cost as well, and reduce the cost by avoiding unnecessary tests versus the humans. So that's a function of cost being factored into the orchestrator at inference time, which wouldn't be something that you could reconcile inside of a single model in pre-training or post-training.

**In medicine, cost is a factor. You know, you could order every single test and probably do better diagnosing people, but it's just not a reality today. And it is interesting to watch the bot work through which tests to order and then come in at a lower cost than typical doctors.**

More tests also make people feel anxious. So it's not just cost, but it's actually the patient experience that gets optimized for as well.

## Reducing Cost and Test Anxiety Through Smarter AI

**And so how does it decide which tests to order and how to optimize cost?**

What the model is trying to do is to get to the best diagnosis with the minimum number of tests. The model has much broader range of awareness of which test results tend to correlate with which particular diagnostic outcomes. And so given that it's seen so many more cases than any given human, it's showing that it can do a better job of judging, in this instance, given this case history that it already knows about a patient, what is the minimum number of necessary tests to get the next piece of information to be able to continue the diagnosis and get it more accurate.

## Current Limitations and Long-Tail Use Cases

**Can I tell you something else that surprised me? It seemed like the bot struggled with more common type of diagnoses. Do you think it's just like waiting to diagnose that rare case? So it skips over the fact that it could just be a stomachache?**

We haven't applied it to your everyday sort of GP or primary care physician experience, where you have a skin rash, or you've got a pain with your knee, and so this does tend to be the longer tail of complex cases. But it goes without saying that there is less of that information in the training data. And we know that if there is more training data, the models do better. So the model is almost certainly going to do better in those primary care type environments than it's doing on the long tail.

## AI Won’t Replace Empathy and Human Guidance

**Your release around this research says doctor clinical roles are “much broader than simply making a diagnosis. They need to navigate ambiguity and build trust with patients and their families in a way that AI isn't set up to do.”**

**Can I just take the other side of this? If you're talking with a bot every day, you might trust it more than a doctor you see once a year, or even a new specialist. So AI poised to take on some of that work as well?**

It's possible that it will do some of that work. Certainly, I hope one day that it will be good enough to do that kind of work. But nothing is going to replace the human to human connection that you get in the physical, real world at a moment of heightened anxiety and fear, when you're just facing one of the biggest challenges in your life and you have a massive diagnosis ahead of you, or when you just need everyday, regular treatment and care. So that's going to continue to be the role of a doctor, and hopefully they get to spend more time face to face with patients.

## The Doctor’s Role Is Evolving, Not Disappearing

**So doctors become something of auditors of the output of these AI bots in the future? They're becoming shepherds that are shepherding patients through their care journey?**

There's still going to be a tremendous amount of judgment that is required by expert human doctors, both as part of the diagnosis, and then secondly, making the judgment about what works for the patient, and factoring in, and helping a patient decide what journey do I want to take, given that I now know I've got this diagnosis, what treatments do I want to take and when, and what are the trade-offs there. So that is going to require a tremendous amount of judgment, and so it's not just about the human-to-human connection and being on your feet. It's also thinking in a deeply empathetic way alongside a patient that's received a diagnosis to plan their treatment course.

## Beyond Healthcare: Orchestrated AI for Any Field

**What other professions could you see this being applied to this type of system?**

The basic method of these orchestrators is that they tune different AIs to play very specific roles and then have the AIs negotiate with one another. That obviously applies to a lot of different environments, be it in business or even in government in the future. And so I think if this finding holds and applies to other domains, I think it will be be very, very promising, because it's also how we, collectively as a human species, work, right? We generally consult very widely when we make decisions, often, there's even consensus before actually coming to a final conclusion. So it has a lot of parallels to the human world.

## What’s Next for MAI-DxO in Clinical Settings?

**Lastly, this isn't being rolled out broadly in a hospital setting yet, so everyone who's panicking at this point can relax. But is that the ultimate goal? Is it an education tool, or does this actually become integrated in medical centers and hospitals in the coming years?**

At the moment, this is just early research, and we're figuring out how best to deploy it, but I think the fact that we're able to get a 4x improvement on human performance across the board, on diagnosis with significantly reduced cost in super fast time — to me, that feels like steps towards a true medical super intelligence, and we would want to try and make that available as widely as possible, as quickly as possible, including for our 50 million daily health queries. And so that's going to be our ambition: Get it in front of consumers as fast as possible, in the safest way possible.

Text: For a student wondering what to study, a teacher rethinking how to teach, or a business owner managing a workforce—artificial intelligence is no longer theoretical. It’s personal. And it’s why we believe some of the most important work ahead isn’t just building smarter machines—it’s ensuring those machines help people thrive.

That’s why today we’re announcing [Microsoft Elevate](https://www.microsoft.com/Elevate) and the [AI Economy Institute](https://aka.ms/AIEconomyInstitute)—to ensure that as AI transforms our world, we’re putting people first by equipping them with the skills, knowledge, and tools to thrive with AI.

Microsoft Elevate brings into one organization our technology support, donations, and sales for schools, community colleges, and nonprofit organizations. It is the successor to and expands upon the longstanding work of Microsoft Philanthropies and the Tech for Social Impact team that supports nonprofits.

More broadly, this represents our next chapter for corporate philanthropy and our non-commercial business model. As we have with Tech for Social Impact, we will run this new business with commitments to reinvest a share of our profits into nonprofit programs. We are announcing today that over the next five years, we will donate on a global scale more than $4 billion in cash and AI and cloud technology to K-12 schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofits to help advance their missions.

Microsoft Elevate will also pursue the next phase of our global skilling programs and initiatives. Through the Microsoft Elevate Academy, it will help bring AI education and skills to people around the world. In the next two years, the Microsoft Elevate Academy will help 20 million people earn an in-demand AI skilling credential ranging from foundational fluency to advanced technical training. Working in close coordination with other groups across Microsoft, including LinkedIn and GitHub, Microsoft Elevate will deliver AI education and skilling at scale. And it will work as an advocate for public policies around the world to advance AI education and training for others.

Microsoft will partner with governments on a national, state, and local basis, as we have with the largest state in Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia. It will focus on advancing AI education and training with schools, community colleges, and nonprofits. It will launch new and innovative initiatives, including the support we’re announcing today for a new [“Hour of AI” with Code.org](https://code.org/hourofai/?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=conference&utm_campaign=hour-of-ai). It will build on our existing partnerships with leading labor organizations, as we announced yesterday with the American Federation of Teachers. And we will pursue many more partnerships to come. Put together, these efforts represent a bold step to create the skilling infrastructure the world will need to put AI to work.

### A moment to reflect

Today’s tech sector is in an AI race—with some aiming to be the first to reach artificial general intelligence or even superintelligence. But what do we really hope to create at the supposed finish line?

The best time to ask hard questions about AI’s future is now—before it becomes even more powerful and pervasive. History shows that technology can empower creativity, expand knowledge, and connect people. But it can also deepen divides. Nearly 150 years after Thomas Edison lit his first light bulb, hundreds of millions still lack electricity. And in just 15 years, social media has gone from what people saw as a promising tool to spread democracy to a weapon of disinformation.

As we look ahead, we must ask ourselves: Are we building machines to replace people, or to help people thrive? Are we trying to create AI that will outsmart humanity—or elevate it?

At Microsoft, we’re putting a clear stake in the ground: we believe in advancing AI by putting people first.

### Elevating the humanity of work

This initiative is part of a broader commitment to help people shape the future of work, not just react to it.

Work has always been more than a paycheck. It’s how people contribute, grow, and find meaning in their lives. It’s a source of identity, purpose, and dignity. This isn’t a new idea. Two thousand years ago, Aristotle called it _eudaimonia_—the ability to flourish through purposeful activity. That idea still resonates today, especially as AI begins to reshape the nature of work itself.

AI is a powerful tool that can help us learn and be more productive. But as with any tool, it needs to be used in the right ways and with a broad perspective. This is one of the lessons from the use of social media. We’ve probably all experienced someone connecting on their phone with a friend far away while ignoring a family member sitting in the same room. We need to use AI to think more, not less. And this is a function not only of technology but culture and habits. It will require thoughtful conversations in homes, schools, and in the workplace about how we make the best use of AI.

Ultimately, the conversation about AI and jobs must begin with people—not just productivity. Machines can process data, but only humans can exercise judgment. Machines can mimic language, but only humans can offer empathy. Machines can optimize, but only humans can care. The goal isn’t to build machines that replace us—it’s to build machines that help us do more and do it better.

One key to success will be partnerships, so a broad array of stakeholders can have input into where AI is going. That means working with governments, educators, labor unions, employers, and community leaders to ensure AI reflects human values and serves human needs.

This is why we have been deepening our partnerships with labor organizations like the AFL-CIO and, as announced yesterday, with the [American Federation of Teachers](https://www.aft.org/press-release/aft-launch-national-academy-ai-instruction-microsoft-openai-anthropic-and-united), or AFT, to deliver AI training to union members, apprenticeship instructors, and educators—including a new National Academy for AI Instruction and a summer skilling series across the building trades. We’re also working with policymakers to encourage public policies that support lifelong learning, workforce readiness, and equitable access to AI education.

### A new corporate think tank: Microsoft’s AI Economy Institute

It’s important to acknowledge that we don’t have all the answers to the new questions that AI will pose for societies around the world. No one does.

To support our work with deeper research and policy insight, Microsoft Elevate will work in close coordination with the Microsoft AI Economy Institute. We started work this past January on what is a new kind of corporate think tank—one designed to bridge the gap between technological innovation and societal impact.

Housed within the [AI for Good Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ai-for-good-research-lab/?msockid=36ea52cb9a16665915f541009ba567d8) and building on the best traditions of Microsoft Research, the Institute sponsors and convenes researchers to explore how AI is reshaping work, education, and productivity. It’s focused on turning those insights into real-world solutions that inform Microsoft’s strategy and public policy engagement.

The Institute supports academic research that explores the transformative potential of AI around the world. Current projects, representing academics from universities across the globe, began earlier this year and span from investigating how generative AI can drive transdisciplinary academic innovation to addressing policy gaps in African higher education to evaluating the real-world labor market value of AI skills and micro-credentials. This work underscores the Institute’s commitment to inclusive, evidence-based insights that shape responsible and globally relevant AI futures. With fast publication cycles and a commitment to open collaboration, the Institute ensures that its research reaches not only internal teams but also the public and policymakers around the world.

The Institute’s work will directly inform Microsoft Elevate’s skilling programs and initiatives, helping to create the training programs, partnerships, and policy frameworks needed to prepare people for the AI economy.

Through workshops, convenings, and applied research, the AI Economy Institute is poised to become a leading voice in the global conversation on AI and economic transformation—ensuring that the benefits of AI are broadly shared and that the infrastructure for inclusive growth is built alongside the technology itself.

This is part of an even broader ongoing effort to advance AI as a tool for good around the world. This will include the evolution of our AI for Good Lab, which advances applied research projects to use AI to meet societal needs. It also includes our support for responsible AI with a wide variety of partners, including universities, nonprofits, and the AFL-CIO and its members. It also includes faith-based organizations, including the Vatican and its Rome Call for AI Ethics. And important intergovernmental organizations, including key United Nations agencies.

### Building on a 50-year legacy

More than any other tech company, Microsoft’s 50-year history gives us a unique appreciation for what it takes for people and technology to flourish together. Because the PC and our operating systems have always functioned as open platforms, we understand how to support a broad global ecosystem of software developers and innovators. And because Microsoft strived early on to put “a computer on every desk and in every home” when that seemed like an implausible dream, we appreciate what technology success truly requires. It’s based not only on great innovations but also critical work to make these innovations accessible and to equip people with the skills needed to use them in their daily lives.

This is the work ahead—not just building the next generation of AI but building the next generation of opportunity. With Microsoft Elevate, we’re investing in people, institutions, and ideas that will ensure AI serves everyone. Because AI shouldn’t strip away the humanity of work—it should elevate it.

ai  · healthcare

June 30, 2025

by Dominic King & Harsha Nori

The Microsoft AI team shares research that demonstrates how AI can sequentially investigate and solve medicine’s most complex diagnostic challenges—cases that expert physicians struggle to answer.

Benchmarked against real-world case records published each week in the New England Journal of Medicine, we show that the Microsoft AI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO) correctly diagnoses up to 85% of NEJM case proceedings, a rate **more than four times higher than a group of experienced physicians.** MAI-DxO also gets to the correct diagnosis more cost-effectively than physicians.

—

As demand for healthcare continues to grow, costs are rising at an unsustainable pace, and billions of people face multiple barriers to better health – including inaccurate and delayed diagnoses. Increasingly, people are turning to digital tools for medical advice and support. Across Microsoft’s AI consumer products like Bing and Copilot, we see over 50 million health-related sessions every day. From a first-time knee-pain query to a late-night search for an urgent-care clinic, search engines and AI companions are quickly becoming the new front line in healthcare.

We want to do more to help -and believe generative AI can be transformational. That’s why, at the end of 2024, we launched a dedicated consumer health effort at Microsoft AI, led by clinicians, designers, engineers, and AI scientists. This effort complements Microsoft’s broader health initiatives and builds on our longstanding commitment to partnership and innovation. Existing solutions include [RAD-DINO](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/2-ai-breakthroughs-unlock-new-potential-for-health-and-science/?msockid=19771d4a045b683800b708f2057c69fd) which helps accelerate and improve radiology workflows and [Microsoft Dragon Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/healthcare/2025/03/03/meet-microsoft-dragon-copilot-your-new-ai-assistant-for-clinical-workflow/?msockid=19771d4a045b683800b708f2057c69fd), our pioneering voice-first AI assistant for clinicians.

For AI to make a difference, clinicians and patients alike must be able to trust its performance. That’s where our new benchmarks and AI orchestrator come in.

### Medical Case Challenges and Benchmarks

To practice medicine in the United States, physicians need to pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), a rigorous and standardized assessment of clinical knowledge and decision making. USMLE questions were among the earliest benchmarks used to evaluate AI systems in medicine, offering a structured way to compare model performance – both against each other and against human clinicians.

In just three years, generative AI has advanced to the point of scoring near-perfect scores on the USMLE and similar exams. But these tests primarily rely on multiple-choice questions, which favor memorization over deep understanding. By reducing medicine to one-shot answers on multiple-choice questions, such benchmarks overstate the apparent competence of AI systems and obscure their limitations.

At Microsoft AI, we’re working to advance and evaluate clinical reasoning capabilities. To move beyond the limitations of multiple-choice questions, we’ve focused on sequential diagnosis, a cornerstone of real-world medical decision making.  In this process, a clinician begins with an initial patient presentation and then iteratively selects questions and diagnostic tests to arrive at a final diagnosis. For example, a patient presenting with cough and fever may lead the clinician to order and review blood tests and a chest X-ray before they feel confident about diagnosing pneumonia.

Each week, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) – one of the world’s leading medical journals – publishes a Case Record of the Massachusetts General Hospital, presenting a patient’s care journey in a detailed, narrative format. These cases are among the most diagnostically complex and intellectually demanding in clinical medicine, often requiring multiple specialists and diagnostic tests to reach a definitive diagnosis.

How does AI perform? To answer this, we created interactive case challenges drawn from the NEJM case series – what we call the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark (SD Bench). This benchmark transforms 304 recent NEJM cases into stepwise diagnostic encounters where models – or human physicians – can iteratively ask questions and order tests. As new information becomes available, the model or clinician updates their reasoning, gradually narrowing toward a final diagnosis. This diagnosis can then be compared to the gold-standard outcome published in the NEJM.

Each requested investigation also incurs a (virtual) cost, reflecting real-world healthcare expenditures. This allows us to evaluate performance across two key dimensions: diagnostic accuracy and resource expenditure.  You can watch how an AI system progresses through one of these challenges in this short video.

_Walkthrough of how MAI-DxO works through a case to reach a diagnosis_

### Getting to a Correct Diagnosis

We evaluated a comprehensive suite of frontier generative AI models against the 304 NEJM cases. The foundation models tested included GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and DeepSeek.

Beyond baseline benchmarking, we also developed **the Microsoft AI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO),** a system designed to emulate a virtual panel of physicians with diverse diagnostic approaches collaborating to solve diagnostic cases.  We believe that orchestrating multiple language models will be critical to managing complex clinical workflows. Orchestrators can integrate diverse data sources more effectively than individual models, while also enhancing safety, transparency, and adaptability in response to evolving medical needs. This model-agnostic approach promotes auditability and resilience, key attributes in high-stakes, fast-evolving clinical environments.

The MAI-Dx Orchestrator turns any language model into a virtual panel of clinicians: it can ask follow-up questions, order tests, or deliver a diagnosis, then run acost check and verify its own reasoning before deciding whether to proceed.

MAI-DxO boosted the diagnostic performance of every model we tested.  The best performing setup was MAI-DxO paired with OpenAI’s o3, which correctly solved 85.5% of the NEJM benchmark cases. For comparison, we also evaluated 21 practicing physicians from the US and UK, each with 5-20 years of clinical experience. On the same tasks, these experts achieved a mean accuracy of20% across completed cases.

MAI-DxO is configurable, enabling it to operate within defined cost constraints. This allows for explicit exploration of the cost-value trade-offs inherent in diagnostic decision making. Without such constraints, an AI system might otherwise default to ordering every possible test – regardless of cost, patient discomfort,  or delays in care. Importantly, we found that MAI-DxO delivered _both_ higher diagnostic accuracy and lower overall testing costs than physicians or any individual foundation model tested.

Comparison of AI powered diagnostic agents by accuracy and average diagnostic test cost per case.Top performing agents appear toward the top left quadrant, reflecting higher accuracy and lower cost.The lower dotted line represents the performance range of the best individual foundation models.The purple line traces the performance of MAI-DxO across different configurations. The red cross indicates the average performance of 21 practicing physicians.

### What’s Next?

Physicians are typically characterized by the breadth or depth of their expertise. Generalists, like family physicians, manage a wide array of conditions across ages and organ systems. Specialists, such as rheumatologists, focus deeply on a single system, disease area or even condition. No single physician, however, can span the full complexity of the NEJM case series. AI, on the other hand, doesn’t face this trade-off. It can blend both breadth and depth of expertise, demonstrating clinical reasoning capabilities that, across many aspects of clinical reasoning, exceed those of any individual physician.

This kind of reasoning has the potential to reshape healthcare. AI could empower patients to self-manage routine aspects of care and equip clinicians with advanced decision support for complex cases. Our findings also suggest that AI reduce unnecessary healthcare costs. U.S. health spending is nearing 20% of US GDP, with up to [25% of that estimated to be wasted – per having little influence on patient outcomes](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752664).

Of course, our research has important limitations. Although MAI-DxO excels at tackling the most complex diagnostic challenges, further testing is needed to assess its performance on more common, everyday presentations. Clinicians in our study worked without access to colleagues, textbooks, or even generative AI, which may feature in their normal clinical practice.  This was done to enable a fair comparison to raw human performance.

A novel aspect of this work is its attention to cost. While real-world health costs vary across geographies and systems, and include many downstream factors that we don’t account for, we apply a consistent methodology across all agents and physicians evaluated to help quantify high level trade-offs between diagnostic accuracy and resource use.

For us, this is just the first step. We’re energized by the opportunities ahead. Important challenges remain before generative AI can be safely and responsibly deployed across healthcare. We need evidence drawn from real clinical environments, alongside appropriate governance and regulatory frameworks to ensure reliability, safety, and efficacy. That’s why we’re partnering with leading health organizations to rigorously test and validate these approaches—an essential step before any broader roll out.

Together with our partners, we strongly believe that the future of healthcare will be shaped by augmenting human expertise and empathy with the power of machine intelligence. We are excited to take the next steps in making that vision a reality.

### — Q&A

**Is this AI safe to use for healthcare?**

The work presented here is not yet approved for clinical use and would only be approved after rigorous safety testing, clinical validation, and regulatory reviews. For now, this represents exciting initial research. At the heart of any plans to deploy this technology in the real world is our commitment to safety, trust, and quality ensuring that any healthcare solutions are clinically grounded, ethically designed, and transparently communicated.

**Will AI replace doctors?**

While AI is becoming a powerful tool in healthcare, our team of practicing clinicians believes AI represents a complement to doctors and other health professionals. While this technology is advancing rapidly, their clinical roles are much broader than simply making a diagnosis. They need to navigate ambiguity and build trust with patients and their families in a way that AI isn’t set up to do. Clinical roles will, we believe, evolve with AI giving clinicians the ability to automate routine tasks, identify diseases earlier, personalize treatment plans, and potentially prevent some diseases altogether. For consumers, they will provide better tools for self-management and shared decision making.

**What is an AI orchestrator?**

In the context of generative AI, an orchestrator is like a digital conductor helping to coordinate multiple steps in achieving a complex task. In healthcare, the role of orchestration is crucial given the high stakes of each decision. Our orchestrator sits above underlying language models making sure each point in getting a diagnosis is handled systematically, reducing the risk in future of errors and offering the necessary stability, consistency and transparency to ultimately build trust from users.

**Why have you looked at costs?**

We initially wanted to understand whether the AI was simply requesting excessive diagnostic workups to reach the right diagnosis. What we found was that our Orchestrator was able to reach the correct answer with much less money spent on testing. In some ways this is not a surprise as diagnostic over-testing is recognized as being a widespread challenge, accounting for millions of unnecessary tests annually in the US. This work suggests AI creates an opportunity for clinicians – and consumers – to reach a faster, more accurate diagnosis while reducing costs.

2025-07-28 13:17:39,711 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The summary provided contains a mix of information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other companies, as well as general market and technology sector trends. Here is the sentiment analysis focused on Apple Inc.:

1. **Stock Performance and Market Sentiment**: Apple's stock has experienced a decline of 15% year-to-date, attributed to concerns over tariffs and its AI strategy. Despite this, analysts maintain a "buy" rating with a median target price suggesting a potential upside. This indicates a mixed sentiment where the current challenges are balanced by potential future gains. **Sentiment Score: -1** (Mildly negative due to current stock decline and AI concerns, but potential upside provides some balance).

2. **Legal and Executive Developments**: Apple is facing a class action lawsuit alleging securities fraud, which is a negative development. However, the appointment of a new COO could positively impact operational strategies. The mixed analyst ratings reflect uncertainty. **Sentiment Score: -2** (Mildly negative due to legal challenges and mixed market sentiment).

3. **AI Strategy and Competitive Pressure**: Apple's AI strategy is under scrutiny, with competitors like Meta recruiting its AI executives. This highlights competitive pressure and challenges in AI development. However, potential acquisitions like Perplexity AI could enhance capabilities. **Sentiment Score: -2** (Mildly negative due to competitive pressure and AI strategy concerns).

4. **Strategic Partnerships and Supply Chain**: The $500 million deal with MP Materials to produce rare earth magnets and develop a recycling facility is a positive strategic move, supporting U.S. supply chain independence. **Sentiment Score: +2** (Mildly positive due to strategic supply chain enhancement).

5. **Analyst Ratings and Earnings Outlook**: Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have reiterated "Overweight" ratings, citing strong product sales and potential earnings growth. However, concerns over tariffs and AI strategy remain. **Sentiment Score: +1** (Mildly positive due to strong product sales and analyst support, tempered by ongoing concerns).

Overall, the sentiment for Apple Inc. is mixed, with both positive strategic moves and negative challenges impacting its outlook. The sentiment scores reflect the balance of these factors, with a slight tilt towards the negative due to current stock performance and AI strategy concerns.

2025-07-28 13:22:11,738 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The financial news summaries for Microsoft Corp (MSFT) present a complex picture of both positive and negative developments, with a strong emphasis on the company's strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services. Here's a sentiment analysis based on the provided summaries:

1. **Positive Developments in AI and Cloud Services**: Microsoft has shown significant growth in its Azure cloud services, with a 33% year-over-year revenue increase, and plans to invest $80 billion in AI and data centers by 2025. The company's strategic focus on AI, including its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI tools like Copilot, positions it as a leader in the tech sector. Analysts have given the stock a "Strong Buy" rating, with price targets suggesting potential upside. These developments indicate strong investor confidence and a positive outlook for Microsoft's future growth. **Sentiment Score: +4**

2. **Layoffs and Restructuring**: Despite the positive momentum in AI and cloud services, Microsoft has announced significant layoffs, affecting approximately 9,000 employees, primarily in its gaming division. These layoffs are part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and focus on strategic growth areas. While layoffs can be seen as a negative development, the market's reaction, with the stock reaching a milestone above $500, suggests that investors view these moves as necessary for long-term success. **Sentiment Score: -1**

3. **Financial Performance and Market Position**: Microsoft's financial performance remains robust, with strong earnings and revenue growth. The company's market capitalization and profitability metrics indicate a solid financial position. Analysts' positive ratings and increased price targets reflect confidence in Microsoft's strategic direction and market leadership. **Sentiment Score: +3**

4. **Challenges and Competitive Pressures**: Microsoft faces competitive pressures from other tech giants like Amazon and Google, particularly in the cloud services sector. Additionally, the high valuation of Microsoft's stock may pose risks if growth expectations are not met. These challenges highlight the competitive landscape and the need for Microsoft to continuously innovate and adapt. **Sentiment Score: -2**

Overall, the sentiment for Microsoft Corp is predominantly positive, driven by its strategic focus on AI and cloud services, strong financial performance, and investor confidence. However, the impact of layoffs and competitive pressures tempers the overall sentiment. **Final Sentiment Score: +3**

2025-07-28 13:24:39,598 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The sentiment analysis for Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) based on the provided news summaries is as follows:

1. **Positive Financial Performance and Strategic Moves**: Alphabet reported strong financial results, with a 14% year-over-year revenue increase to $96.4 billion, surpassing expectations. Google Cloud revenue rose 32%, exceeding estimates, driven by advancements in AI. These results indicate robust growth and effective strategic focus on AI, which is a positive development for the company's financial outlook. However, the stock declined slightly due to increased capital expenditure forecasts, which suggests some investor concern about future spending. Overall, the strong financial performance and strategic focus on AI are positive, but the market's reaction to increased spending tempers the sentiment slightly. **Sentiment Score: +3**

2. **Challenges in AI and Market Position**: Alphabet faces challenges in the generative AI sector, which could impact its competitive position. Additionally, hedge funds reducing their holdings in tech stocks, including Alphabet, signals broader market concerns. These factors suggest potential headwinds for Alphabet's stock and financial outlook. **Sentiment Score: -2**

3. **Technical and Market Indicators**: The formation of a "golden cross" in Alphabet's stock is a bullish technical indicator, suggesting potential for a breakout in stock price. This, combined with upward revisions in earnings expectations, supports a positive outlook for the stock. **Sentiment Score: +2**

4. **Regulatory and Competitive Challenges**: Alphabet is dealing with antitrust lawsuits and competition from AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which could disrupt its core search business. These challenges pose risks to Alphabet's financial outlook and market position. **Sentiment Score: -3**

5. **Partnerships and Strategic Investments**: Alphabet's partnership with Roblox to enhance immersive advertising and its increased capital expenditures focused on AI infrastructure indicate strategic moves to strengthen its market position and capitalize on growth opportunities. These developments are positive for the company's long-term prospects. **Sentiment Score: +2**

6. **Market Reaction and Broader Economic Factors**: Despite strong financial results, Alphabet's stock performance has lagged, partly due to broader economic factors and sector-specific issues. This reflects the challenges tech companies face in maintaining investor confidence. **Sentiment Score: 0**

Overall, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is experiencing a mix of positive financial performance and strategic initiatives, tempered by challenges in the AI sector, regulatory issues, and broader market concerns. The sentiment is moderately positive, reflecting the company's strong financial results and strategic focus on AI, but acknowledging the risks and challenges it faces. **Overall Sentiment Score: +1**

2025-07-28 13:57:20,458 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The sentiment analysis for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news summaries is as follows:

1. **Legal Challenges and AI Strategy Concerns**: Apple is facing a securities fraud lawsuit related to its AI capabilities, which has led to a stock decline. Concerns about Apple's AI strategy and competitive position in the AI sector are highlighted, with some analysts suggesting Apple is lagging behind competitors. This situation is compounded by potential revenue losses from an antitrust lawsuit involving Alphabet. These legal and strategic challenges present a negative outlook for Apple's financial position and market reputation. **Sentiment Score: -4**

2. **Stock Performance and Analyst Ratings**: Despite a year-to-date stock decline of 15% and concerns over tariffs and AI strategy, analysts maintain a "buy" rating with a median target price suggesting a potential upside. However, the high PEG ratio raises concerns about sustaining growth without new product catalysts. This mixed sentiment reflects both challenges and potential opportunities for Apple's stock. **Sentiment Score: -1**

3. **Strategic Developments and Partnerships**: Apple's $500 million deal with MP Materials to produce rare earth magnets and develop a recycling facility in the U.S. is a positive strategic move. This partnership supports U.S. supply chain efforts and aligns with Apple's investment in domestic manufacturing, potentially enhancing its market position. **Sentiment Score: +3**

4. **Earnings and Market Position**: Analysts have a positive outlook on Apple's stock driven by strong smartphone upgrade environment and robust growth in its Services segment. However, skepticism about Apple's AI efforts and competitive risks remain. The reiteration of "Overweight" ratings by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, along with increased price targets, indicate confidence in Apple's financial performance. **Sentiment Score: +2**

5. **Market Volatility and Trading Opportunities**: The focus on options trading ahead of Apple's earnings report highlights anticipated stock volatility, presenting opportunities for profit. This reflects investor interest in Apple's financial performance and its impact on the stock's trajectory. **Sentiment Score: +1**

Overall, the sentiment for Apple Inc. is mixed, with significant challenges related to legal issues and AI strategy, but also positive developments in strategic partnerships and analyst confidence in its financial performance. The aggregate sentiment score, considering all factors, is **0**, indicating a neutral outlook with both positive and negative elements influencing Apple's financial sentiment.

2025-07-28 14:03:13,662 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The sentiment analysis for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news summaries is as follows:

1. **General Market Position and Performance**: Apple has experienced a year-to-date decline of 18%, underperforming the broader market. This is attributed to trade tensions and a lack of a clear AI strategy. Despite these challenges, historical data suggests a potential rebound in July. The sentiment here is mildly negative due to the stock's underperformance and strategic concerns. **Sentiment Score: -2**

2. **AI and Competitive Position**: Apple is perceived as lagging in AI development compared to competitors, impacting its competitive edge. This perception could affect investor confidence and market position. The sentiment is negative due to the strategic disadvantage in a critical technology area. **Sentiment Score: -3**

3. **Legal Challenges**: Apple faces a securities fraud lawsuit related to misrepresentations about AI capabilities, which has led to stock declines. This legal issue poses a risk to investor confidence and market perception. The sentiment is negative due to the potential legal and reputational impact. **Sentiment Score: -3**

4. **Strategic Developments**: Apple announced a $500 million deal with MP Materials to boost its domestic supply chain, which is a positive strategic move. However, the impact on Apple's stock was minimal. The sentiment is mildly positive due to the strategic alignment with U.S. manufacturing goals. **Sentiment Score: +1**

5. **Analyst Ratings and Market Perception**: Morgan Stanley and Citi have reiterated positive ratings for Apple, citing strong sales and strategic factors. However, concerns remain about AI strategy and geopolitical risks. The sentiment is neutral to mildly positive due to mixed analyst views and strategic uncertainties. **Sentiment Score: +1**

6. **Leadership and Market Confidence**: Jim Cramer's support for CEO Tim Cook highlights confidence in Apple's leadership amidst challenges. This endorsement may positively influence investor sentiment. The sentiment is mildly positive due to leadership confidence. **Sentiment Score: +1**

7. **Stock Performance and Market Dynamics**: Apple's stock has shown some recovery with recent gains, but overall performance remains challenged by broader market dynamics and strategic concerns. The sentiment is neutral to mildly negative due to mixed stock performance and ongoing challenges. **Sentiment Score: -1**

Overall, the sentiment for Apple Inc. is mixed, with a slight negative tilt due to strategic challenges, legal issues, and underperformance in key areas like AI. The company's strong market position and strategic initiatives provide some positive offsets, but uncertainties remain significant. **Overall Sentiment Score: -1**

2025-07-28 16:06:56,470 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The sentiment analysis for Amazon (AMZN) based on the provided financial news summaries is as follows:

1. **Stock Performance and Market Trends**: The stock has experienced a decline of 1.28% over the past five days and 5.27% over the past month, contributing to a year-to-date decrease of 2.08% and a 17.51% drop over the past year. This indicates a negative sentiment as the stock performance has been declining over various time frames. However, the market capitalization remains significant at $2.29 trillion, and the P/E ratio reflects investor expectations of future growth. Overall, this suggests a mildly negative sentiment due to the stock's recent performance. **Sentiment Score: -2**

2. **Analyst Ratings and Price Targets**: Bank of America and Bernstein have raised their price targets for Amazon, maintaining a "Buy" rating, with expectations of strong performance in e-commerce and AWS. This reflects positive sentiment from analysts, indicating confidence in Amazon's growth potential, particularly in cloud computing and AI-related services. **Sentiment Score: +3**

3. **Jeff Bezos' Stock Sales**: Jeff Bezos' significant stock sales are part of a pre-arranged plan and do not indicate immediate operational changes. The market reaction was muted, suggesting that investors did not view it as a bearish signal. This is a neutral sentiment as it reflects personal wealth management rather than company performance issues. **Sentiment Score: 0**

4. **Macroeconomic and Competitive Pressures**: Amazon faces challenges from tariff agendas, inflation, and competitive pressures, which could impact profitability and logistics operations. Despite these challenges, there are potential offsets from increased AI adoption in digital advertising and AWS. This presents a mixed sentiment with negative macroeconomic factors but potential positive offsets. **Sentiment Score: -1**

5. **Strategic Developments and AI Focus**: Amazon's advancements in AI and strategic positioning in cloud computing are highlighted as significant growth drivers. Analysts have increased price targets based on these developments, indicating a positive outlook for Amazon's market standing and competitive dynamics. **Sentiment Score: +4**

6. **Regulatory and Legal Challenges**: Amazon faces regulatory scrutiny in India and the UK, with significant lawsuits and investigations that could impact operations and strategies. These legal challenges present a negative sentiment due to potential financial and operational implications. **Sentiment Score: -3**

7. **Cloud Computing and AI Investments**: Amazon's focus on AI and cloud computing, including new hardware developments for Nvidia chips, underscores its strategic positioning in these sectors. This reflects a positive sentiment as it enhances Amazon's competitive edge in the rapidly growing AI sector. **Sentiment Score: +3**

Overall, the sentiment for Amazon is mixed, with positive developments in AI and cloud computing being offset by stock performance declines, macroeconomic pressures, and regulatory challenges. The combined sentiment score, considering all factors, would be slightly positive due to the strong emphasis on strategic growth areas like AI and cloud computing. **Overall Sentiment Score: +1**

2025-07-28 16:12:06,386 - news_sentiment.news_collator - INFO - Raw sentiment response: The summary provides a comprehensive overview of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and its recent developments, highlighting both positive and negative aspects that could impact the company's financial outlook and stock performance.

1. **Positive Developments**: 
   - Palantir has experienced a significant stock price surge, surpassing $150, driven by strong earnings, new partnerships, and government contracts. The company has secured $568.9 million in government contracts over the past year, highlighting its strong position in the sector.
   - The company's stock has surged in 2025, largely due to the success of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which caters to both government and commercial clients. Palantir reported a 39.4% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter, attracting significant interest from institutional investors.
   - Palantir's strategic positioning in the AI sector, with potential implications for its competitive standing against peers like Datadog and Zscaler, is noted by Bank of America as building momentum for the stock.
   - The company has launched "Warp Speed for Warships," a new initiative in collaboration with the U.S. Navy and BlueForge Alliance, aimed at digitally transforming the maritime supply chain and shipbuilding ecosystem, marking a significant expansion of Palantir's defense business.

2. **Negative Developments**:
   - Despite robust financial performance, Palantir's valuation at 123 times sales makes it the most expensive stock in the S&P 500, raising concerns about potential overvaluation. Historical data suggests that software companies with similar high valuations have experienced significant declines.
   - Insider trading reveals 234 sales and only one purchase, indicating potential profit-taking by insiders, which could signal a lack of confidence in the stock's future performance.
   - The stock is trading at historically high valuations, raising concerns about a potential sell-off. Notable investors have shown mixed reactions, with some reducing their positions while others have increased their stakes, indicating uncertainty about the stock's long-term trajectory.

3. **Mixed Sentiment**:
   - Analyst ratings are divided, with a median price target of $110, reflecting uncertainty about the stock's future trajectory. The consensus among Wall Street analysts is cautious, with a "Hold" rating and a mean target price indicating a potential downside of up to 30%.
   - Despite the stock's volatility, with 47 moves greater than 5% over the past year, today's increase to $148.09 per share marks a new 52-week high. Palantir's shares have risen 97% since the beginning of the year, highlighting its key role in the expanding AI industry.

Overall, while Palantir Technologies Inc. has demonstrated strong growth and strategic positioning in the AI sector, concerns about its high valuation and potential overvaluation pose risks to its stock performance. The mixed sentiment among analysts and investors reflects the uncertainty surrounding the company's future trajectory.

**Sentiment Score**: +3 (Positive developments outweigh the negative concerns, but the high valuation and potential overvaluation risks temper the sentiment.)
